<p class="noindent">The idea of investigating the story of the Scottish
Expedition to Norway in 1612 occurred to the
author on a trip through the beautiful valleys of
Romsdal and Gudbrandsdal in the autumn of 1884&mdash;many
of the statements made on that subject in guide-books,
and in almost every work on Norway, having
appeared incredible when he left the highway and
explored the old bridle-path along which the Scots
marched on their way to Sweden.</p>

<p>Subsequent researches in State Archives, made with
the kind assistance which has been heartily acknowledged
in the pages that follow, resulted in the discovery
of official documents hitherto unavailable, and
with their aid the traditional account of the "Skottetog"
has, in its chief outlines, been reduced to strict
historical proportions.</p>

<p>The information thus acquired was utilized by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
author in a lecture delivered in 1885 at the University
of Christiania, in the gracious presence of His
Majesty the King of Sweden and Norway, for the
benefit of the Building Fund of the Anglican Church
in that city.</p>

<p>It is with the same practical object that, with the
generous co-operation of the publishers, the lecture has
been embodied in the little book now commended to
the attention of those who take an interest in Scottish
history, as well as to that of the British and
American travellers who visit in such largely increasing
numbers the beautiful and hospitable valleys and
highlands of Norway, in which they find so much
sympathetic evidence of a common origin of both
race and language.</p>

<p class="noindent">More than two centuries and a half have elapsed
since the date of the occurrence so well known in
Norway as the "Skottetog," or Scottish expedition, of
which but little has hitherto been authentically known
in Scotland. Notwithstanding, therefore, the conspicuous
position which the so-called "Sinclair Expedition"
holds in the traditions,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and to some extent also in
the literature and the art,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of Norway, a fresh examination
of the subject by the impartial light of
historical truth is justified by the recent discovery of
several documents in the State Archives of England,
Scotland, and Sweden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Mönnichhofen's expedition through Stordalen,
and the Scottish invasion of Romsdalen and
Gudbrandsdalen which formed an integral but unsuccessful
part of that expedition, took place in 1612,
no account of the latter appeared in print earlier than
the year 1688, when Puffendorff wrote his "Introduction
to Swedish History;" and it was only three
years later that Widikindi, another Swedish historian,
gave a narrative of it in a History of Gustavus
Adolphus.</p>

<p>Among Danish historians, Niels Slange was the
first of any eminence to reproduce the now palpable
errors of Puffendorff and Widikindi, in a History of
Christian IV., written in 1732.</p>

<p>In 1782, the subject of the Skottetog first became
popularized in Norway by the publication, in
a periodical journal called the <em>Dansk Museum</em>, of the
spirit-stirring poem by Edvard Storm, which Norwegian
children still learn by heart and in song, and
which has even been well circulated in the English
and German languages.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

As depicted by the Norwegian artists Tiedemann and Gude.
</div></div>

<p>But the first really important contribution towards
the history of the event was made in 1838, when
Dean Krag of Vaage dedicated to the descendants of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>the Bönder<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who had fought at Kringelen the <em>Sagas</em>,
or traditions, he had personally collected in Gudbrandsdalen,
annotated with such historical references
as were then available.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>While the traditions he has so scrupulously preserved
for us are of great interest, if only because
they indicate plainly the source of the information
on which Swedish, Danish, and even Scottish accounts
of the expedition into Romsdalen had been chiefly
based, he enriched history with copies of the first and
only documents that had apparently ever been drawn
before his time, from State or other archives, relative
to the Scots who landed in Romsdalen. Those documents
were: a Report by the Norwegian Stadtholder,
Envold Kruse, to the Danish Chancellor, dated Aggershuus,
17th September 1612; and three deeds of gift
of land (all dated 3rd September 1613) to Lars
Hage, Peder Randklev, and Berdon Sejelstad, for their
bravery and loyal devotion on that occasion.</p>

<p>In that laborious little work Dean Krag pointed
out that, with the exception of Kruse's first Report (of
which he had obtained a copy from Copenhagen), all
the writers after Puffendorff (1688) and Widikindi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>(1691) had repeated, more or less, only what those
two historians had related. He also showed that
Storm's poem had been preceded by a popular ballad
on the same subject, and of which he collected and
printed as much as was still extant in Gudbrandsdalen.</p>

<p>More recent historical research resulted in the discovery,
also at Copenhagen, of a second Report from
Envold Kruse, the Stadtholder, dated 3rd October
1612. It was first published between 1858 and
1860,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and was reproduced in a little work printed
at Molde in 1877.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The history of the Scottish expedition to Norway
in 1612 has, therefore, until this day been supported
in Scandinavian accounts by only two documents of
indisputable authority&mdash;namely, the two Reports of
Envold Kruse, of which the second was brought to
light less than twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Nor have Scottish and English historians<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
writers, so deeply interested in the question, been
more successful in discovering and making use of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>authentic contemporary documents. A careful examination
of their several descriptions, both of Mönnichhofen's
expedition and of that of the Scots, reveals
the fact that their information had been derived either
from the old Danish and Swedish historians already
mentioned, or more recently from the traditions current
in Gudbrandsdalen. Those accounts may consequently
be dismissed as unworthy of serious attention.</p>

<p>But the Public Record Office in London has at last
delivered up its long-hidden treasures, consisting of the
correspondence that passed between King James I. of
England (VI. of Scotland) and Sir Robert Anstruther,
his ambassador or envoy at Copenhagen, on the subject
of the Scottish levies for Sweden in 1612.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In
the General Register House, Edinburgh, have also been
preserved<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the acts and proclamations of the Scottish
Privy Council in respect of those proceedings; while
the keeper of the State Archives in Stockholm has
supplied copies of several documents<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>hitherto been published, amongst which must be mentioned
a letter or commission issued by Gustavus
Adolphus II.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to Sir James Spens of Wormiston, a
Scottish officer of high rank, found sometimes in the
service of James I., sometimes in that of Sweden.</p>

<p>That commission is of more especial value, since it
explains the connection between the expedition of
Mönnichhofen and that of the Scots.</p>

<p>The former enterprise&mdash;an important part of the
famed Skottetog&mdash;is not the subject of any Norwegian
Sagas, or of any popular ballads, but Scandinavian
historians have dealt with it somewhat more
correctly than with the Scottish expedition, probably
because the Dutch contingent reached Sweden, and
thereby supplied living testimony as to the circumstances
that attended its march through Stordalen
into Jemtland.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the first documents relating to that
daring exploit were not published before 1858, in a
Norwegian historical magazine. These were copies of
letters from Steen Bilde, amtmand, or prefect; Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Jensson Jude, burgomaster; and Jacob Pederson,
lagmand,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> all of Trondhjem&mdash;addressed to the Danish
Chancellor, and dated severally between the 15th
August 1612 and the 19th February 1613.</p>

<p>Some years later&mdash;namely, in 1877&mdash;Dr. Yngvar
Nielsen of Christiania published<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> "Some Notices
respecting Johan von Mönnichhofen," derived from a

<br />
<span class="small">THE CALMAR WAR, AND SWEDISH MEASURES FOR
RAISING MERCENARIES.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">Such being the documents and the information at last
available in the matter of the Mönnichhofen and Scottish
expeditions of 1612, it is time to narrate briefly why
auxiliary troops were at that time wanted in Sweden.</p>

<p>When Gustavus Adolphus, on the 26th December
1611, took into his own hands, at the age of seventeen,
the government of Sweden, his first step was to seek
the conclusion of peace with Denmark; and with that
object he formally surrendered the title of King of the
Lapps, the assumption of which by his father had caused
so much ill blood between Christian IV. and Charles IX.
that it became one of the principal causes of the so-called
Calmar War, commenced in the spring of 1611.</p>

<p>The overtures of Sweden and the offered mediation
of Great Britain and other powers were rejected by
Denmark, and the war was thereupon continued with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
great vigour, but with varying success on either side.
However, in the early summer of 1612 the Danes
took the important fortresses of Elfsborg and Gullberg,
and having the entire command of the Cattegat
and the Belts, cut off Sweden from the sea. Later,
the Danish fleet anchored inside the rocks at Stockholm,
of which the seizure was averted only by the
bold strategy of Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>This abortive attempt on the capital of Sweden
practically concluded the war. Peace was ultimately
signed at Knäröd, in Halland, January 18, 1613.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>During that war the Danish monarch had in his
service about eighteen thousand English,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> French, and
German mercenaries; while Gustavus Adolphus, having
on his side<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> only one foreign regiment of eight or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>nine companies, soon found himself "in need of foreign
soldiers as well, wherewith to check the attacks of the
enemy."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Charles IX. had indeed foreseen such a
necessity, but no action was apparently taken in that
direction until the month of November 1611, when
Gustavus Adolphus addressed to Sir James Spens the
letter or commission already mentioned, and when
also the Queen Dowager of Sweden issued an order<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
for the payment of 10,500 rigsdaller out of a fund at
Lübeck to Mönnichhofen, then preparing to proceed
to the Netherlands for the enlistment of men, who,
according to the letter addressed to Sir James Spens,
were to have joined the Scottish auxiliary contingent
at Elfsborg. On the 2nd December 1611 Mönnichhofen<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
was appointed commander-in-chief of the
Swedish ships-of-war with which he was to have
sailed from Elfsborg and brought back his levies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Money being apparently scarce, orders were given
that he should be supplied with a certain quantity of
ox-hides, for sale on his arrival in Holland, to meet
the further expenses of his expedition. But the
original plan of fetching and transporting the Netherlands
levies in Swedish ships-of-war was ultimately
abandoned, and Mönnichhofen reached Holland by
another route.</p>

<p>The letters discovered at Stockholm by Dr. Yngvar
Nielsen prove that Mönnichhofen had by the 1st June
1612 embarked a force of about twelve hundred men
at Amsterdam on board four ships, which were detained
for five weeks by contrary winds. Mönnichhofen
had, therefore, the Swedish agent writes, incurred
"extraordinary expenses, to the extent of at
least four thousand thalers, in providing the men in
the small ships with food and drink, and had consequently
to pledge and mortgage all he possessed." He
had "also encountered much difficulty and incurred
great expense in keeping his men together even
before the ships lay wind-bound."</p>

<p>Although in most Danish and Swedish histories the
troops enlisted by Mönnichhofen in Holland are stated
to have been Scottish, there is no documentary proof of
such having been their nationality. The Netherlands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
were at the time full of foreign auxiliary troops, the
republic having, on the signature of the truce of 17th
June 1609, retained in its service 6,000 French, 3,000
English, and 3,000 Germans, but only 2,000 Scots.
The absence of all mention of Scottish officers being
with Mönnichhofen; the rivalry that existed between
the military adventurers of that period; the circumstance
that General Halkett,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> a Scottish officer, was in
Amsterdam at about the same period, engaged, not in
enlisting Scots, but in hiring a ship to transport levies
from Scotland; and more especially the fact that
Mönnichhofen had been instructed to procure arms for
the men simultaneously levied in Scotland;&mdash;all this
leads us to infer that Mönnichhofen, himself a Fleming,
enlisted Hollanders, and perhaps Germans.</p>

Sweden, he was at the siege of Calmar, at which they were all, with
the solitary exception of himself, wounded. A Scottish officer deponed
at Copenhagen that Mönnichhofen had alone escaped on that occasion

on the part of his Scottish brethren in arms, for he certainly showed great

<span class="small">SUCCESSFUL MARCH OF MÖNNICHHOFEN THROUGH
NORWAY.</span></h3>


<p class="noindent">According to the Report of the same Swedish agent,
Mönnichhofen sailed at last on the 14th July from
Amsterdam,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and landed five days later in Stordalen,
on the coast of Norway&mdash;at that time united with the
Crown of Denmark&mdash;without combining, as originally
intended, with the levies made in Scotland, although
measures for their detention were taken only on the
4th August following.</p>

<p>The ships (evidently Dutch) which had transported
his troops to Norway returned safely to Amsterdam
with the information that Mönnichhofen had disembarked
"three or four miles above Trondhjem, in
Moersdall," and that his men had landed in such an
ill-conditioned state that they "could not reach Sweden
without great difficulty and danger."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>When read in connection with the Reports of the
Swedish agents at Amsterdam, first discovered and
made known by Dr. Yngvar Nielsen in 1877, the
letters of Steen Bilde, C. J. Jude, and J. Pederson<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
afford a credible and fairly complete account of that
expedition. Those collective documents show that
it was not composed, as alleged by Niels Slange, of
"about fourteen hundred soldiers, or Scots," enlisted
in Scotland, but nominally of twelve hundred men
raised in the Netherlands under the circumstances
already described.</p>

<p>The burgomaster of Trondhjem (who, like Bilde
and the other Danish officials, was interested in over-rating
rather than in under-rating the strength of the
invaders,) reported, on 15th August 1612, that the
expedition consisted of "eight hundred soldiers, besides
their women and boys;" and according to Cronholm,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Gustavus Adolphus himself wrote that the
number of those men, when they arrived in Jemtland,
out of all further danger, amounted to eight hundred.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The four small Dutch ships could scarcely have carried
more, especially if the men were accompanied by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>their women and children, as alleged by the burgomaster.</p>

<p>The Swedish and Danish historians relate that
Mönnichhofen took his men to Scotland, and sailed
from thence, in command of a combined force, for the
coast of Norway; but all these statements only serve
to prove yet more conclusively that the true history
of the foreign levies made for Sweden in 1612 has
until quite recently lain hidden in State Archives.</p>

<p>Mönnichhofen sailed from Amsterdam on the 14th
July 1612, and having landed in Norway on the 19th
July, could not possibly have carried out the original
plan of joining his levies with those made in Scotland.
Besides, the documents now brought to light prove
that the small portion of the intended Scottish contingent
that escaped the vigilance of the Scottish
Council of State did not sail for Norway until the
2nd of August.</p>

<p>According to the Reports of the Trondhjem officials
above mentioned, Mönnichhofen seized two other ships
off Giske (which place he plundered), put some of his
soldiers on board, and compelled the Norwegian vessels
to pilot his own fleet of four ships into Trondhjem
roads. In order to prevent the enemy from entering
the river, Steen Bilde removed the poles and buoys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that marked the channel, brought six iron cannon
down to the sea-shore, and hastily made many other
arrangements for repelling an anticipated attack on
the city. As it grew dark soon after the ships had
anchored, the fire opened upon them from the shore
was harmless; and at daybreak they set sail again,
after firing a few shots in return.</p>

<p>The wind being favourable, they soon rounded a
point on which stood a farm called Viig, where the
soldiers were quickly disembarked and marched towards
Meragerfjeld, four or five Norwegian (twenty-eight
to thirty-five English) miles distant.</p>

<p>They reached the summit of the fjeld without
much molestation from the three military officers in
command of the "frontier guard" of about two hundred
soldiers or militia, reinforced by three hundred
mounted Bönder. Steen Bilde and the three officers
had collected a considerable number of peasants (the
burgomaster says fifteen hundred) to repel the invasion;
but according to the prefect, when a part of
those levies reached the enemy, the captain of the
frontier guard "could not get them forward where
they were wanted." The enemy kept them off with
their muskets, which the peasants mistook for cannon,
probably because they were fired from rests, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
their own firearms they considered to be relatively
"pop-guns" (<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Snap-bosser</i>).</p>

<p>Moreover, provisions were unobtainable, as the local
Bönder had fled on the approach of the troops, after
hiding their scanty supplies of food in the woods. A
panic ensued, the common people insisting that the
invaders were "very strong, and picked soldiers and
warriors."</p>

<p>Steen Bilde was subsequently tried and punished
for his alleged remissness in not repelling the enemy,
and therefore some caution is necessary in receiving
the official complaints made by the burgomaster and
lagmand against the peasantry on that occasion, and
which were to the following effect: "How can we
carry on war in this country with peasants? It suffices
to see how they conducted themselves against the
soldiers." Steen Bilde affirmed that the lagmand had
to "ride and walk about the whole of the night to get
those peasants and ill-disposed persons into order;
and yet nothing can be accomplished with them, as
they do not stand, but run away at once when they
see the enemy." He urged in his own defence: "I
did my best, diligently, according to the counsel and
means at hand, and according to what could be accomplished
with those peasants. God comfort those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
who have no other help than peasants on such an
occasion!"</p>

<p>It would appear at this distance of time that both
Steen Bilde and the peasants were unfairly reproached
for their conduct. The sudden landing of so many
armed men was quite sufficient to create a panic,
while the burning of "four farms in Stordalen, and of
all the farms (twelve in all) which lay towards the
river at Merager," was well calculated to strike terror
into and to paralyze a peaceful population.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Under
such circumstances, it would have been difficult to
drive the men back to their ships, even with the
fifteen hundred peasants hastily collected, under the
command of three captains, and supported only by
two hundred soldiers or militia.</p>

<p>Mönnichhofen's troops appear to have had the
same difficulty as the peasant levies in providing
themselves with food; for the men sent by Steen Bilde
into the mountains as scouts found some of the soldiers
dead from hunger, and many pieces of armour as
well as pikes and other weapons thrown away by them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Cronholm<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> asserts that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>progress of the troops, which, laden with booty, were
driving before them the cattle robbed from farms, was
arrested in numerous mountain passes, where the
soldiers were slaughtered by a host of peasants. But
this statement is not in harmony with the Official
Reports made to the Danish Chancellor, or with the
punishment inflicted on Steen Bilde. The latter
pointed out, on the contrary, that if some armed bands
of peasants had understood how to utilize the advantages
afforded by the physical conditions of the highlands,
the rocks and precipices over which the bold
Mönnichhofen and his men made their way "might
easily have become their graves."</p>

<p>However, it is on historical record that the expedition
reached Jemtland, where it found itself on
Swedish soil, the population having previously taken
an oath of allegiance to the Swedish Crown, which at
the end of the war acquired permanently that Danish
province.</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus occupied Herjedalen and Jemtland
in pursuance of a threat made (March 1612)
in a proclamation to the Norwegian peasantry, who
yet spurned the idea of seceding from Denmark, and
had attacked in force the lands on the Swedish borders,
when, according to a contemporaneous writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Dal and Vemland bore the brunt of the Norse onslaught.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In that proclamation Gustavus Adolphus attributed
the war to the Danish king, "whose aim," he said,
"was war and bloodshed, and who had caused,
menaced, and forced both his late father and himself
to have recourse to self-defence." He reminded the
Norwegians how "Sweden and Norway had from the
most ancient days been united by relationship of
descent and language; how there was a time when
they had one and the same king; how the bond that
should unite Norwegians and Swedes was, after all,
closer and more natural than anything that could
unite Norwegians with Danes; and how even geographical
conditions seemed to witness that it was
the will of Fate that Norway and Sweden should
be united."</p>

<p>That far-seeing sovereign therefore called upon the
Norwegians to submit to him as their lord and king,
promising to confirm all their rights and privileges,
and to restore to their legitimate position the remnants
of the old aristocracy of Norway.</p>

<p>This appeal produced gradually the desired effect
both in Herjedalen and Jemtland. The march of Mönnichhofen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
towards the old Swedish provinces was thus
rendered easy; and on receipt of orders from Gustavus
Adolphus, he took the direct road to Stockholm, then
seriously threatened by the fleet of Christian IV.</p>

<p>Gustavus led in person the Netherlands contingent
to Waxholm, a few miles from Stockholm, in order to
attack the Danes, and in a month or so the Calmar
War came to an end.</p>

<br />
<span class="small">ORGANIZATION OF SCOTTISH LEVIES FOR SWEDEN,
AND THEIR FORCED DISBANDMENT</span>.</h3>


<p class="noindent">Having dealt with that part of the general plan of
bringing foreign troops to the aid of Sweden which
was so successfully carried out by Mönnichhofen, we
approach the main subject of this little work&mdash;namely,
the history of the Scottish levies, and of the disaster
that befell the very small portion of them that succeeded
in leaving Scotland and landing in Norway.</p>

<p>Our starting-point in this part of the inquiry must
be the commission addressed by Gustavus Adolphus
to Sir James Spens, Laird of Wormiston.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>It gives an authentic indication of the measures
subsequently adopted for obtaining levies in Scotland
as well as in Holland. The young warrior and statesman
refers to promises made by Sir James Spens to
Charles IX., and to the services which his father had
required of him, urging him to hasten his return (evidently
from Scotland) with the "promised three thousand
soldiers of proved faithfulness and bravery."
He wished them to be infantry, not cavalry. The
main object was the arrival of Sir James Spens at
Elfsborg, by the 1st of April 1612, "with the before-mentioned
number of troops, properly equipped with
the needful accoutrements." Spens was to be paid
at Hamburg the sum of 20,000 imperials, and was
assured that any further expense he might incur in
the matter of the levies would be repaid to him
punctually and with the greatest cheerfulness. Gus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>tavus
Adolphus added: "Furthermore, we have
thought (right) that it should be notified to you that
we have arranged with our general (<em>duce</em>), our truly-beloved
Johannes Mœnichovius, that he is to transport
his thousand infantry, fully furnished with necessary
arms, from Holland to Elfsborg, in the beginning of
spring. If, therefore, you combine your fleet and
army with the ships of the aforesaid Mœnichovius,
we shall be extremely glad."</p>

<p>The execution of this part of the plan was subsequently
rendered impossible by the fall of Elfsborg
and the command which the Danes obtained of the
approaches to Sweden by sea.</p>

<p>The proceedings of Spens in this matter are not
disclosed in the documents so far discovered,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which
prove that Colonel Andrew Ramsay was the active
organizer of the levies in Scotland. King James I.
in one of his letters calls him "the chief of the business,
whose brother all men know what place he hath
with us." The influence Andrew Ramsay possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
at the Court of King James probably caused him to
be engaged by Spens. One of his brothers was Sir
John Ramsey, a favourite of King James, and who,
while one of the royal pages, in the year 1600, was
instrumental in rescuing the king from assassination
at Gowrie House, near Perth. It was another brother
of his&mdash;Alexander Ramsay&mdash;who was the leader of
the small detachment of Scots destroyed at Kringelen,
in Norway, and not George Sinclair, as hitherto
assumed.</p>

<p>That the king's name was privately but unjustifiably
used in the proceedings of Colonel Andrew
Ramsay, was subsequently acknowledged by the
latter, and hence the suspicion arose in Denmark that
King James was cognizant of those proceedings. But
the documents preserved in Edinburgh show that
King James did not become aware of what Andrew
Ramsay and the officers with him were doing in
Scotland until about the 31st July 1612, the date
on which the king wrote to his Scottish Privy Council
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whereas it is said there is a colonel and certain
captains levying men to go to Sweden, we wonder
that any subject of ours dare presume in that kind to
serve any foreign prince, not only without our licence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
but directly against our meaning and special promise
made to our dear brother the King of Denmark<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>....
It is therefore our pleasure that ye certify as to what
that levying of soldiers meaneth; by what authority it
is done; and that ye make stay of all proceedings
therein till ye shall be advertised of our further
pleasure concerning that matter."</p>

<p>Nine days later, the king wrote to his envoy at
Copenhagen<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> that he had heard, "by mere accident,
of levies in Scotland ready to embark under Ramsay,
Steward, and some other captains;" and "being displeased,
gave order presently for the stay of the levy.
And whereas good numbers of them were already embarked
before His Majesty heard the news, or ready
to embark, His Highness hath given order to discharge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>them, and doth utterly disavow any acts of theirs,"
etc.</p>

<p>But the Danish king was already well acquainted
with those proceedings; for the British envoy at Copenhagen
wrote to King James on the 10th August
1612 (the king had written to him on the 9th August)
that the King of Denmark was informed that "one
Menigowe, a Fleming, having in company with him
fifteen hundred men, is to meet with Andrew Ramsay
in some part of the north of Scotland, about Caithness
or Orkney, who has more than a thousand Scottish
men with him; and so they mind to join their forces
together, and to fall upon Norway and spoil some
towns, and so go into Sweden." The King of Denmark,
added the envoy, had been informed by persons
from Scotland that Ramsay had levied men about
Edinburgh and embarked them at Leith; and His
Majesty argued that "such levies so near Edinburgh
could not be done without permission of the State."</p>

<p>Indeed, the excuses of the Scottish Privy Council,
to the effect that the levies had been made secretly,
did not satisfy even King James, who wrote to his
envoy that, to quote his own expression, he "misliked
some dulness of theirs."</p>

<p>The action taken by the Scottish Privy Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
immediately on receipt of the peremptory orders of
the king was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 4th August 1612 a proclamation was issued
"discharging the transporting of soldiers to Sweden,"
and another "against the soldiers enlisted for Sweden;"
while two acts were passed&mdash;the one "charging" or
accusing "Captains Hay, Ker, and Sinclair" of having
enlisted men for the wars of Sweden, and ordering
them to desist from their enterprise, etc.; the other
summoning Colonel Andrew Ramsay to appear before
the Council to "hear and see His Majesty's will,
pleasure, and direction" in respect of the men of war
enlisted under his pay and command to be transported
to Sweden. Next day the Lords of the Council
ordered officers of arms "to pass, command, and charge
the masters, owners, skippers, and mariners of ships
and vessels freighted for transport of soldiers to
Sweden, that they bring in their ships to the harbour
of Leith, and there suffer them to lie," and not to set
sail until they know the Council's will and pleasure
towards them, under pain of being denounced as
rebels and "put to the horn."<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>On the 15th August an act was passed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Council, ordering that "the companies of men lately
enlisted under the charge and commandment of Colonel
Ramsay and some other captains, for the wars of
Sweden, be broken up, and that they shall in no wise
be transported to Sweden;" and on the same day another
act, ordaining that the companies under Colonel
Ramsay, who had meanwhile professed his willingness
to render obedience to the king by disbanding them,
should be landed, one half at Leith, the other half at
Brunt or Burnt Island, on the other side of the Forth.</p>

<p>The latest document regarding these matters, obtained
from the General Register Office in Edinburgh,
is dated the 18th September 1612. Colonel Andrew
Ramsay had been summoned to appear before the
Council on the latter date, to answer regarding the
unlawful levying of troops; and having failed to do
so, he was forthwith denounced as a rebel.</p>

<p>Those acts and proclamations<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> give a very interesting
and, indeed, important insight into the methods
Colonel Andrew Ramsay and his confederates had
adopted in Scotland.</p>

<p>We first of all find that Sir Robert Ker had apprehended
in the middle shires<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of Scotland a number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>of malefactors, part of whom he sent, or rather intended
to send, to Sweden. In the second place, the
proclamations assert that the Scottish officers therein
named "have violently pressed and taken a great
many honest men's sons, and have carried them to
their ships against their will, of purpose to transport
them to Sweden." They are accused of going "about
the country in a swaggering manner, awaiting the
time and occasion how and where they may apprehend
any persons travelling on their lawful adois,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
and if they be masters of them they immediately
lay hands on them and by force and violence
convey them to the next shore, where they have
their boats in readiness to take them on board of
their ships.... So that there is such a fear and dread
arising among the common people that none of them
dare travel," unless they be "able to withstand and
resist the violence and injury of the said persons." ...
"And divers young fellows," continues the proclamation,
"who were resolved to have come to these parts
to have awaited upon the harvest and cutting down
of the corn are," for those reasons, "afraid to come
here." In the charge against Captains Hay, Ker, and
Sinclair, it is alleged that the "honest men's bairns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and servants" are detained on board the ships "as
slaves and captives."</p>

<p>Any person disobeying the orders of the Council
was threatened with the penalty of death. The
levies were to be discontinued, the ships seized, their
sails taken from the yards, and the men on board set
at liberty; but not before the local authorities had
visited the vessels, and taken out of them and
delivered over to the bailies of Edinburgh "the persons
who had been delivered to them by the Commissioners
of the late Borders," as well as the persons
whom Colonel Ramsay and his captains had received
out of the tolbooths of Edinburgh and Dunbar.</p>

<p>The remainder of the companies were ordered to
be landed, as already said, at Leith and Burntisland,
but on condition that the men should not remain
together or travel back in groups of more than two
after their disembarkation, under penalty of death,
to obviate the possibility of their committing acts of
violence on passing through the country.</p>

<p>The remarkable fact that, in all these stringent
and detailed regulations for the disbanding and landing
of so many men, no mention whatever is made
of the most ordinary military precaution of disarming
them will be noticed in a succeeding chapter.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Sir James Spens was the son of "Spens of Wormiston," who made
Lennox, the regent of Scotland, captive at the seizure of Stirling by the
forces of Kirkaldy in 1571, and who was slain at the same time while protecting
his prisoner. The personage in question, so high in the favour of
Gustavus Adolphus, was a prominent type of the Scottish adventurer of
that age. He went to Sweden in 1610 as envoy from King James I.,
there being at the time a question of betrothing Gustavus Adolphus, then
Crown Prince, to an English princess&mdash;namely, to Elizabeth, the daughter
of James I., married subsequently to Frederick, the Elector Palatine of
the German Empire. We find him later in Denmark, offering the mediation
of England between Christian IV. and Charles IX. On this occasion
he was so ungraciously received at Copenhagen that he narrowly
escaped with his life. Sir James Spens entered the Swedish military
service, from which, however, he was recalled by King James, who, a
short time after, sent him back to Stockholm as ambassador, in which
character he invested Gustavus Adolphus with the Order of the Garter,
and took part in the negotiations that resulted in the Peace of Knäröd.
On one occasion he went to England as ambassador from the Swedish
Court. In 1622 he was created Baron Spens of Orreholmen, in Vestergotland.
He died at Stockholm in 1632, after having been made, in 1629,
General in Command of the English and Scottish regiments in the pay of
Sweden.</p></div>

the "Lord of Wormiston" landed at Elsinore on the 4th June 1612,
having been sent simultaneously with Sir Robert Anstruther to arrange
a peace between Denmark and Sweden. The Danish Chancellor was
induced to grant him a safe-conduct into Sweden; "whereupon a nvmber
hath wondred and thinks he shall haue small thank for his panis."
F. H. Jahn, the Danish historian of the Calmar War, asserts that Spens
was "secretly supported in his recruiting business."</p></div>

1589) at Oslo, now a suburb of Christiania, to Anne, sister of Christian IV.
of Denmark. She had previously gone through the ceremony of marriage
with Earl-Marshal Keith, as proxy for the king, at the castle of Cronenberg;
but on their way to Scotland the Danish ships, driven by storms to
the coast of Norway, landed the princess at Oslo. With great gallantry
King James came over to fetch her with a large fleet, and remained
at Oslo, after his marriage there (performed by Robert Bruce, court
chaplain), until the 21st January 1590, when he sailed with his bride for
Copenhagen. The ties of relationship, and the duties and obligations of
King James towards his "good brother" the King of Denmark, are fully
recognized in the documents now published; but the impartial historian
cannot fail to take into consideration the character of that sovereign and
his conduct in other matters, such as the negotiations with Spain and the
family interests connected with them.</p></div>

<span class="small">ORDERS OF KING JAMES I. DISOBEYED BY A FEW
SCOTTISH OFFICERS, WHO PROCEED WITH A SMALL
PORTION OF THE LEVIES TO NORWAY</span>.</h3>


<p class="noindent">The vigorous measures of the Council were not, however,
adopted in sufficient time to prevent a small
contingent of the Scottish levies from crossing over
to Norway.</p>

<p>On the 17th September 1612, the Norwegian
Stadtholder Kruse announced to the Danish Chancellor
the arrival of two Scottish ships at Romsdalen
between the 19th and 20th August, and the destruction
at Kringelen, on the 26th August, of all the
men, except eighteen, that had landed from those
vessels.</p>

<p>On the 26th October 1612, Sir Robert Anstruther
reported the matter in the following terms to King
James:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doubtless your M<sup>tie</sup> hath heard of that unfortunate
accident, that happened unto 300 of your M<sup>is</sup>
subjects, which landed in Norroway under the conduct
of Alexander Ramsay, Lieutenant-Colonel unto
Colonel Ramsay, Captain Hay, and Captain Sinclair.
After they had marched six days within the country,
pressing to go through to Sweden, (they) were over-charged
by the inhabitants of the country, and all
killed, except some few, of which the said Lieutenant
Ramsay,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and Captain Bruce,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> James Moneypenny,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and James Scott<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> these four, were sent to Denmark.
After their coming hither a Council of War was
called, to have examined them, and afterwards to
have given judgment upon them. After I had spoken
with them, and found that their journey was enterprysed
(undertaken) rashly, and rather simple than
well advised, for not one of them had any kind of
commission or warrant to show, neither from the
late King Charles, neither from Gustavus, neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>from Colonel Ramsay; wherein first they would have
been condemned of great simplicity or ignorance: and
next found to be plain invaders, and ravers of the
king's dominions and subjects, and a severe judgment
would have followed. In regard the king was much
discontented, for eviting of this public censure and
danger, I thought good to labour to have them
privily examined in the presence only of the Chancellor
and Bredo Rantzow, where I was myself (unworthy)
present. Their deposition is sent with themselves
unto your M<sup>tie,</sup> hoping it shall be far better for
them to come into the hands of your Royal M<sup>tie,</sup> who
ever had used grace and clemency unto those that
offend of simplicity, not of wilfulness."</p>

<p>In a letter of the same date to the king's secretary,
the envoy stated that the 300 Scots had all been
"killed and murdered," except some few.</p>

<p>The deposition in question of Alexander Ramsay,
made in Latin, was to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>He had been appointed to the post of Lieutenant-Colonel
by Andrew Ramsay, who, on his part, had
declared that he had been appointed to the office of
Colonel by a letter from Charles, King of Sweden.
Andrew Ramsay had told him that the levying of
men in Scotland had been carried on with the know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>ledge
and approval of His Majesty of Great Britain&mdash;"that
an agreement had been made between himself
and two others: George Sinclair and George Hay,
each being in command of a hundred infantry."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> He,
Alexander Ramsay, "had embarked at Dundee: but
the two aforesaid captains had set sail from Caithness."
"They had crossed the sea relying on the
words and promises of Andrew Ramsay; and the
Council of the Kingdom of Scotland was unacquainted
with those matters." "A stopping-place,"
he further deponed, "had been fixed upon beforehand,
off Shetland, where Mönnichhofen with a thousand
soldiers and 3,000 arms and General Halkett<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of Scotland
with a thousand infantry, were to meet, the
number increasing to 3,000." Lastly, that they had
set sail from that place on the second day of August,
James Nisbet of Edinburgh having "taken upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>himself the risk which the ship" (in the singular&mdash;probably
Ramsay's) "might incur," and that the Norwegian
peasants showed them the way "when they
had landed at Romsdal in Iisfiord."</p>

<p>Alexander Ramsay and his three companions were
"sent home to their country," King James finding
them "no otherwise in fault than as abused by Ramsay."
This Colonel Andrew Ramsay, after being a
fugitive in Scotland, was apprehended in England on
the occasion of his seeking a quarrel (or duel) with
Sir Robert Carr of Ancram,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> whom he accused of
having divulged to the king his "gathering of men
in Scotland."</p>

<p>On being examined, on the 27th November 1612,
in the presence of the Duke of Lennox and Viscount
Fenton, he confessed that he had a commission from
the King of Sweden for levying men, and that he
had undertaken and gone about to levy men in Scotland
out of ignorance, not knowing but that he might
lawfully "take such as would go." For his fault, he
submitted himself to His Majesty's mercy, "as also
for using the king's name to induce others, which he
confesseth he did, and promised them to stand between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
them and any danger." At the same time, he denied
ever having had "any leave, oversight, or connivance
directly or indirectly from the king, either by himself,
or by means or signification of any other body."
Nor had he acquainted any member of the king's
Council of Scotland with his doings, or "received
any encouragement from them or any else."</p>

<p>This deposition was transmitted to Denmark, King
James ordering Sir Robert Anstruther to say that
Andrew Ramsay's "fault being of that nature as doth
not forfeit life or limb, and the custom of declaring
Schellum"<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> (which the King of Denmark had
evidently suggested as a punishment for the breach
of his parole not to serve Sweden) "being not with
us in use, we have by our warrant under our hand
banished him out of all our dominions; which next
unto death is the highest punishment we could
inflict."</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of the history of the Scottish
levies, we proceed to inquire into the fate of the small
detachment that landed in Norway under the command
of Alexander Ramsay.</p>

<br />
<span class="small">THE LANDING OF ALEXANDER RAMSAY IN ROMSDALEN</span>.</h3>


<p class="noindent">The Scots disembarked at a place since named Skothammer,
or Skotkleven (the Scots' Cliff), in the
vicinity of Klognæs farm, in a part of the Romsdal
fiord called the Iisfiord, some miles from the
present hamlet of Veblungsnæs, which was not then
in existence. The Sagas of Gudbrandsdal, collected
by Dean Krag, begin with a stirring account of the
patriotism of Peder Klognæs or Klungnæs, the occupant
of the farm of that name, who is popularly
supposed to have prevented the two Scottish vessels
from proceeding higher up the fiord, by representing
that there was not sufficient water for them. He is
therefore credited with the skilful deception of having
induced the Scots to march two Norwegian miles
(about fourteen English miles) out of their way, round
the Iisfiord, over mountains and marshes, and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
roadless forests intersected by almost impassable
streams; all which delayed their progress, and enabled
Peder to send a message to the authorities and
to the Bönder, to save their goods in advance of the
troops.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>It is more likely that the real reason for landing
at Skotkleven was the desire of the shipmasters to
get back to sea as quickly as possible, and not further
endanger their safety by entering into a narrower
and more remote part of the fiord.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to follow and criticise the
remainder of the Sagas, such as the meeting of Sinclair
with the old woman (transformed by Edvard
Storm into a mermaid), who predicted he "would
come to bite the dust when he met the hardy men of
the glen," and the romantic story of Guri, the maiden
who made signals to the Bönder, and played a plaintive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
melody from the summit of a very high and
distant cliff. The noble sacrifice another girl is reputed
to have made of her lover, whom she sent to
save the wife of Sinclair, is a story so very touching
that we may be glad if future historical research
should lead to the discovery that Captain Sinclair
was accompanied on his adventurous expedition, not
by "wild Turks" or bloodhounds,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> but in reality by
a wife and baby.</p>

<p>This Captain George Sinclair, whose name has
been wrongly given to the Scots' expedition, was a
son of David Sinclair of Stirkoke, the illegitimate son<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
of John, Master of Caithness, the eldest son of George,
fourth Earl of Caithness. He was therefore a bastard
nephew of George, fifth Earl of Caithness, who employed
him, while he was preparing to leave for
Norway, in the betrayal of Lord Maxwell, and in
making him prisoner at Castle Sinclair, near Thurso.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> No mention is made of Peder Klognæs in the Reports made by Envold
Kruse, who merely says the Scots took with them "two Bönder in Romsdalen
as guides." Andrew Ramsay and his companions deponed at
Copenhagen that "the peasants showed them the way when they landed
at Romsdal in the Iisfiord." Moreover, Peder Klognæs was not amongst
those whom Christian IV. rewarded. The traditions respecting Peder
Klognæs bear an extraordinary resemblance to those which attach in Russia
to a popular hero named Ivan Susanin, whose devotion to his sovereign, by
misleading a detachment of Poles in 1611, forms the subject of the patriotic
Russian opera called "Life for the Tsar." Kostomaroff, a modern Russian
historian of high standing, has proved that the peasant in question never
rendered any such service, as neither the Czar nor the Polish detachment
had been in the locality indicated at the time to which the legend refers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> Lord Maxwell had been banished the realm for the slaughter of the
Laird of Johnstone; but returning into Scotland in 1612, he had sought
and obtained the hospitality of his friend the Earl of Caithness, whose
countess was Lord Maxwell's cousin. In the hope of obtaining a reward
from the king and favour from the Court and Privy Council, this Earl of
Caithness, with the aid of Captain George Sinclair, delivered Lord Maxwell
to the Council, and he was hanged at Edinburgh in the year 1613.
</p>
<p>
In the account given of this treacherous transaction by Sir Robert
Gordon, it is mentioned that Captain George Sinclair was at that time
"preparing himself for Sweden," and that the earl had sent him into
Caithness to seize Maxwell, "under pretence of taking up men for his
voyage to Sweden." The historian adds, that while the Earl of Caithness
never obtained his expected reward, Captain George Sinclair "came
to his deserved end" in Norway; and his version of the affair is, that as
Sinclair "would not be persuaded by Colonel Ramsay to stay for him
until he could be ready also to go," "he went forward with Captain Hay
into Sweden," and so ran "headlong to his own destruction."&mdash;("History
of the Earldom of Sutherland.") His brother, John Sinclair, was killed
in the same year (1612) at Thurso.
</p>
<p>
Sir Robert Gordon is, however, not quite reliable in his account of
that transaction, for he says that George Sinclair, "hearing of the wars
then likely to fall out, and <em>which ensued shortly between the Kings of Denmark
and Sweden</em>, he gathered together 150 men in Caithness. Having
made up this company, he joins with Colonel Ramsay and Captain Hay
to go into Sweden." The Calmar War commenced in the spring of 1611,
a year before the levies were made in Scotland; and we have seen that
Sinclair had arranged with Lieutenant-Colonel Ramsay and Captain Hay
to raise one hundred men each (the strength of a company of infantry in
those days), and that only three hundred men were landed by them in
Romsdalen.</p></div></div>

<br />
<span class="small">DESTRUCTION OF THE SCOTS IN GUDBRANDSDALEN</span>.</h3>


<p class="noindent">In his first Report<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to the Danish Chancellor, dated
September 17, 1612, the Norwegian Stadtholder stated
that when Lauritz Hage, Lensmand of Vaage in
Gudbrandsdalen, heard of the arrival of the Scots
in Romsdalen, "he at once roused the Bönder and
peasantry in the two parishes of Lessje and Vaage,
and went forth against the said Scots and foreign
troops. And when he perceived they were too strong
for him, he advanced for two or three days and kept
before them along the road, without, however, engaging
in any skirmish or fight. Meanwhile, he sent
messengers to the peasantry in the two adjoining parishes,
called Froen and Ringeböe, who quickly came
to his assistance; and when they were in this manner
gathered they were 405 men strong. Thus he advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>in front" (of the Scots) "along the road until
he saw his advantage at a fjeld called Kringelen, situated
in Vaage parish, which they were obliged to pass.
Thus he hemmed them in between the rock on one side
and a large river close by on the other side, in which
advantageous position he quietly encamped in the
woods, and there lay with his men until the foreign
soldiers arrived there, without, however, supposing
or knowing aught but that the Norwegian troops
were still withdrawing along the road before them.
The above-mentioned Lauritz Hage, having made his
arrangements and perceived his advantage, attacked,
together with another lensmand, Peter Rankleff of
Ringeböe, and with all their men together they fired
upon the foreign troops and shot them to death
during an hour and a half. Those who were not
shot jumped into the river to save themselves, but
were there drowned; and those of them who got
alive over the river were quickly killed by the
Bönder on that side; all of which happened and occurred
on the 26th of August last. From the Bönder
who were themselves present at the battle, and
who buried and counted the dead and the defeated,
we learn that the foreign soldiers must no doubt
have numbered at the least 550 men, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the Scots who remained alive, and of whom there
are altogether 18, will not admit that they were more
than 350 men strong at the utmost. On the day
the battle took place 134 Scots were taken prisoners,
who were straightway the next day killed and shot
by the Bönder, with the exception of the above-mentioned
18, the Bönder saying to each other that His
Majesty had enough to feed in those same 18. Some
of these were, however, wounded, and some had bullets
in their bodies, when they arrived here. Of the
above-mentioned 18 soldiers we now send to you the
three principal ones" (mentioning their names&mdash;Alexander
Ramsay, James Moneypenny, and Henry
Bruce). "As regards the remaining 15 persons,
some of them have straightway taken service among
good folk here in the country; some of them who
will willingly serve your Royal Majesty in Jörgen
Lunge's Regiment, I sent at once to Elfsborg."</p>

<p>Reference is made at the end of the Report to the

<p>From Envold Kruse's second Report, dated October
3, 1612,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> we learn that the letters in question were
ultimately recovered by the Bailie of Gudbrandsdalen,

<p>The latter Report contains the following striking
passage, which destroys so entirely the accusations
made against the Scots in the Norwegian Sagas and
in Edvard Storm's poem:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have also since ascertained that those Scots
who were defeated and captured on their march
through this country have absolutely neither burned,
murdered, nor destroyed anything on their march
through this country, either in Romsdalen or in
Gudbrandsdalen."</p>

<p>Only one Dane, of the name of Sören Setnæs, had
complained that the Scots had taken from him a box
or chest of silver objects, such as tankards, belts, etc.;
but even this booty the Bönder would not acknowledge
having found on the killed or captured Scots.</p>

<p>The end of this valuable document is somewhat
damaged, but so far as the injured part can be deciphered,
Kruse stated that six<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of the Norwegian men
were killed, and ten or twelve wounded, in the fight

<br />
<span class="small">THE COMBAT AT KRINGELEN</span>.</h3>


<p class="noindent">We have seen that the historical facts are as follows:&mdash;A
detachment of about three hundred Scots, commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Ramsay and
five other Scottish officers, marched safely, and without
committing any acts of murder, pillage, or incendiarism,
through Romsdalen and Gudbrandsdalen,
as far as Kringelen, where it had opposed to it four
hundred and five Bönder and peasants, under the
leadership of two civil, not military, officers. Further,
that one hundred and thirty-four of the Scots were
taken prisoners, and were all killed the next day,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
except eighteen, who reached Aggershuus, now the
fort of Christiania,&mdash;the loss of the victorious Norwegians
being only six killed and ten or twelve
wounded.</p>

<p>Such a remarkable result could certainly only have
been attained under very advantageous circumstances,
and as existing documents give only the barest outline
of the fight at Kringelen, we can only form an hypothesis
upon them.</p>

<p>The following conjecture is deduced from an attentive
study of all that is so far known or established on
the subject.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that four hundred Bönder,
only partly or imperfectly armed, could not have been
an equal match, even in the early part of the seventeenth
century, for the smallest admissible number of
Scots&mdash;namely, three hundred&mdash;that documentary
evidence will allow us to admit, and especially if they
had been well-armed, trained soldiers. Some of those
Scots, those raised by Sinclair, were apparently Caithness
men, whose principal occupation had no doubt
been warfare.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Many of them were in all probability
descendants of Norsemen who had conquered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and held a great part of their country. They were,
to say the least, as brave and as ready to defend
their lives as the Bönder and peasants of Gudbrandsdal,
a province which had moreover been to
some extent drained of its younger and more able-bodied
men for the purposes of the war of Denmark
against Sweden. We have also seen that the attempts
made to destroy Mönnichhofen's force of about one
thousand men by a levy of one thousand five hundred
peasants, mounted and on foot, supported by some
soldiers and commanded by three military officers,
were quite unsuccessful.</p>

<p>What then were the exceptional circumstances that
rendered possible the easy and utter defeat of the
Scots at Kringelen?</p>

<p>In traditional accounts of the affair, reproduced by
almost every historian, much stress is laid on the
deadly effect of the hurling down of rocks, or of what
is known in Norway as a "<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">tömmervælte</span>," on the heads
of the invaders while they were passing unsuspectingly
through a ravine, pass, or defile at Kringelen. To
those who have not visited the locality in question
such an explanation would perhaps be quite satisfactory;
for there have been instances, both in ancient
and modern history, of troops being destroyed by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
means in mountain passes by an enemy inferior in
number and untrained in skilled warfare.</p>

<p>But an inspection of Kringelen, or a study of the
accompanying plan prepared for this work from actual
survey by Lieutenant Arneberg of the Norwegian
army, renders impossible the acceptance of such an
explanation. The present road, on which stands the
stone pillar that marks the vicinity of the spot where
the fighting occurred, dates from the beginning of this
century. It is about forty feet below the old road,
where it sinks into the "Sinclair Dokka" or hollow,
in which the Scots are popularly believed to have been
overwhelmed by huge masses of rock, and where
human bones, supposed to be those of the Scots, have
been dug up.</p>

<p>In an account<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of a journey from Christiania to
Trondhjem in 1733 by King Christian VI. and Queen
Sophia the road through Gudbrandsdalen is described
as follows:&mdash;"Froen Præstegaard (vicarage). About
here the road begins to show the difficulties travellers
in Norway have to encounter." After passing Zell
"is a road called Kringelen, on the side of a fjeld, and
so narrow that every precaution is necessary on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
part of travellers and drivers." Dr. Yngvar Nielsen
states in his interesting work on the "Development
of Roads in Norway,"<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> that "in 1766 Kringelen
was the worst bit of road in Gudbrandsdalen, as it
was so narrow that a carriole could scarcely pass."
In fact, it was only a bridle-path on the edge of a
precipice fifty to one hundred feet above the Laugen
river. This track, which was all that the condition
of the country required when produce was transported
chiefly in winter on sledges, was quite open and exposed;
while above it the almost precipitous cliffs,
averaging seven hundred feet in height, left at their
base a sloping ledge of about one hundred and
fifty feet in breadth. It was neither a pass nor
a ravine, and has sometimes been described as a
"defile," probably because not more than two men
could have walked abreast along it, and certainly
only a single file of men could have used it with convenience.</p>

<p>The Bönder concealed themselves on the sloping
ledge between the precipitous cliff and the path. The
ledge was somewhat thickly covered with wood, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>is said to have been washed away by a memorable
rainstorm in 1789. At the same time there must
have been a clear space in front both of the "tömmervælte"
and of the intrenchments which tradition says
the Bönder erected there, although Envold Kruse
makes no mention of them.</p>

<p>The military officer who carefully surveyed the
ground in the autumn of 1884 has shown on the plan
the probable position of the celebrated "tömmervælte."
It is supposed to have been an accumulation of rocks
piled on round beams or trunks of trees, arranged in
such a manner as to roll down in a mass as soon as
the ropes which held the structure in position were
cut.</p>

<p>The depression in the old road known as the "Sinclair
Dokka" has a length of about two hundred and seventy
English feet between the highest points at its two
extremities. It is reasonable to suppose that the
object of the Bönder was to hurl down the rocks at
the deepest or centre part of the depression, which
would be about one hundred feet in length at the
utmost, and that the length of the "tömmervælte" was
in proportion with the size of the hollow into which
it was destined to descend. It could not possibly have
been even half as long as the deepest part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
hollow itself; for an artificial structure a hundred feet
in length, with a clear space in front of it, would
certainly have been observed by the Scots, however
unsuspecting they may have been, and however lax
their military precautions. Moreover, it would have
been strategically unwise on the part of the Bönder
to have attacked the invaders until a good part of
them had descended into the hollow and were passing
through it. It has therefore been assumed on the
plan that the "tömmervælte" could not have been
more than thirty feet in length, whilst its height
above the deepest part of the "Sinclair Dokka" has
been fixed at about one hundred and twenty feet, partly
as a result of a thorough examination of the configuration
of the slope on which it stood, and partly on
the conjecture that the structure required elevation in
order to attain a sufficient impetus on being let loose,
and in order also that it should be as much concealed
as possible from the Scots proceeding along the
road.</p>

<p>A mathematical question here presents itself. If
we assume that the Scots on whom the "tömmervælte"
descended occupied the path in the "Sinclair Dokka"
along an approximate length of even one hundred feet,
how many could possibly have stood there? Giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
only three feet to each man, the number could not
have been more than thirty-three men if they marched
in single file, or about sixty-seven if two abreast, along
a path so rugged, narrow, and dangerous. But considering
that the rocks must have taken several
seconds to roll down the declivity, which could not
have had a steeper gradient than forty to forty-five
degrees, the men at the extremities of the threatened
group must have had time to rush back at one
end and forward at the other; and allowing for
further chances of escape, we cannot possibly account
for the destruction of more than twenty-five
or thirty men (even if they walked two abreast)
by the sudden descent of an avalanche of rocks and
timbers.</p>

<p>How then were the remainder disposed of?</p>

<p>As soon as the "tömmervælte" had been cast loose,
it may be taken for granted that the concealed
Bönder rushed down on the startled foe, and that
a hand-to-hand fight ensued. In fact, we know
there was a combat of an hour and a half, in which
Sinclair fell, and that six of the Bönder were killed
and ten or twelve wounded. A few of the muskets
alleged to have been carried by the Scots have
been preserved, the arsenal at Christiania possessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
five,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Horton arsenal one, the descendants of Dean
Krag parts of two or three more, and Consul Heftye
of Christiania a lock. The earliest English travellers
in Norway mention having seen only a few remnants
of those arms in Gudbrandsdalen. From the smallness
of the number of such muskets that have been preserved
or heard of, it must be supposed that the Scots
had not many such weapons. Nor could those few
have been of much use at close quarters on a sudden
emergency such as that at Kringelen, since from the
great length of their barrels (about seventy inches)
they had to be fired from a rest.</p>

<p>The traditional or popular account of the mode of
attack bears on its face a considerable amount of probability.
It is to the effect that the "tömmervælte"
was not cast loose until the "vanguard" of the Scots
had passed.</p>

<p>On the strength of all these facts and considerations
we arrive, in all humility, at the conjecture that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
three hundred Scots were not all armed, and that the
body of men described in the Sagas as the "vanguard"
was most likely the contingent of "honest men's bairns
and servants," and some of the men out of jails,
forcibly pressed by Lieutenant-Colonel Ramsay, and
who were being driven captive into Sweden by Caithness
men under Sinclair and Hay, armed, it may be
conjectured, principally with swords, the officers perhaps
wearing armour and carrying pistols as well as swords.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>It has been already shown that Mönnichhofen was
to have supplied arms for the Scottish levies, with
which he failed to combine. Moreover, the Swedish
agent at Amsterdam reported that he feared the projects
of General Halkett (one of Ramsay's confederates)
would fail, "because of the lateness of the season, and
because the men had no weapons, while everywhere in
Norway the people were up in arms."<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The deposition,
taken at Copenhagen, of Alexander Ramsay, the
leader of the expedition, also shows that Mönnichhofen
was to have supplied the Scots with arms from Holland.
We have moreover seen that in its acts and
proclamations against the proceedings of the Ramsays
and others, the Scottish Privy Council made no mention
of <em>disarming</em> the men who were to be sent home
under precautions that were in other respects so careful.
Nor is it likely that the men who had been
forcibly seized and kept on board the ships would at
once have been supplied with arms by their oppressors.
The remarkable fact that the Scots committed no
depredations in the valleys through which they passed&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>forbearance out of keeping with the custom of
that age, either in Scotland or in Scandinavia&mdash;suggests
that the troops under Ramsay were subject to
strict discipline on so daring and dangerous a march.
This task probably devolved more especially on Captain
Sinclair and Captain Hay, who, while in command
of the armed men employed in guarding and driving
before them the captive "honest men's bairns and servants,"
were the only officers killed;<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and this may
account for the popular belief that Sinclair was the
chief of the expedition.</p>

<p>If therefore the conjecture be correct, that none but
the Caithness men were armed at all, and they chiefly
with swords, the almost entire annihilation of the
three hundred men by four hundred Bönder is seen to
have been easy enough under the circumstances that
have been described.</p>

<p>Such is the conclusion that results from the premises
here submitted; and remembering how important it is
that national history should be correctly known, it is
to be hoped that the researches already made will lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to the lifting of the cloud confessedly hanging over
this episode of the distant past, and that some historian
in time to come may be helped by them, however
slightly, in directing the light of truth upon the
mists that still remain to be dispelled on the subject
of the disastrous expedition of the Scots to Norway
in 1612.</p>

of the atrocious conduct of the Bönder, that some of their countrymen
had met with a similar fate only a few months before. Duke John of
Sweden sent Colonel Kruus to wrest from the Danes the town of Nylödelse
and destroy its fortifications. The commandant was forced to surrender
at discretion on the 26th February 1612, after the foreign troops
in the garrison had mutinied. But while the foreign officers obtained
service in the Swedish army, the Danish leaders, including many armed
Bönder and a party of Norwegian riflemen, were locked up in a church
and all shot down singly.&mdash;F. H. Jahn, "Hist. om Calmarkrigen," p. 175.</p></div>

certified to have belonged to Sinclair, is given at <a href="#Page_126">p. 126</a>. Although undoubtedly
Scotch, and of the period, the initials A. S. engraved on them are
most probably those of Sir Andrew Sinclair. (See <a href="#Footnote_130">note, p. 126</a>.) The
swords, of which so many are still offered for sale as relics of the expedition,
are mostly of doubtful origin. The author is, however, in possession
of a rusty short sword, with the Scottish crown and the letters V. R.
very distinct on the blade, on the broken-off edge of which there would
have been room for the letter J., making J. V. R., or Jacobus V. Rex.
It was found at Kringelen, and is almost exactly like the sword carried
by the third figure in the accompanying illustration, representing some of
the "Irishmen,"&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, the Scots of Mackay's regiment,&mdash;who were landed
at Stettin in 1630. The illustration has been taken from an interesting
work published in 1885, by W. Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh and London,
entitled, "An Old Scots Brigade: being the History of Mackay's
Regiment, now incorporated with the Royal Scots." The author, Mr. John
Mackay, late of Herriesdale, has generously allowed the block to be used
for the purposes of this little work.

Another sword, in a wooden sheath covered with leather, and which
had evidently been used as a walking-stick by some Bonde, was purchased
by the author as an authentic relic of the Scots, and presented by
him to His Majesty King Oscar II., as a weapon that had in all probability
been used in the service of His Majesty's great predecessor, Gustavus
Adolphus. The motto, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honni soit qui mal y pense</span>," engraved on
the long straight blade of the sword, made it all the more appropriate
that His Majesty, as a Knight of the Garter, should be the possessor of
so interesting a relic.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_58" id="Footnote_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> Under the Danish law of that period every able-bodied Bonde was
compelled to provide himself with a musket or arquebuse; but it is most
probable that the men who had not been taken away to fight the Swedes
remained, to a great extent, armed only with pikes, crossbows, and axes,
of which an illustration is given at <a href="#Page_107">page 106</a>.</p></div>

to Aggershuus, he must have shared the fate of George Sinclair. It is also
not improbable that in order to save their own lives when taken prisoners,
the surviving officers pointed to the body of Sinclair as that of their commander.</p></div></div>

REV. H. P. S. KRAG.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span></h3>


<p class="noindent">The so-called Calmar War, between Denmark and
Sweden, was carried on from the spring of 1611 until
the winter of 1613. Christian IV. ruled at that time
over the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway; while in
Sweden reigned Charles IX., who died at the commencement
of the war, leaving its prosecution to his
son Gustavus Adolphus, then only seventeen years of
age, and who subsequently became so famous.</p>

<p>In 1612 Gustavus caused foreign troops to be
enlisted in the Netherlands, in England, and in Scotland,
by <span class="smcap">Johan Munkhaven</span>, or Mönnichhofen, a
colonel in the Swedish service, and by James Spens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
an Englishman. According to the historian Widikindi,
the corps thus raised amounted to 2,200 men,
while Puffendorff estimates its strength at 2,300.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
These troops, of which 2,000 had been recruited in
Scotland, were transported in ships, forming two
squadrons, of which one was commanded by Munkhaven,
the other by the Scottish Colonel George Sinclair,
or Saint Clair, as his name is also written.
Munkhaven, with his 1,400 men, steered into the
Trondhjem fiord on the 19th July 1612, and thought
he would be able to surprise the city of Trondhjem;
but the citizens opposed him and his ships so well
from their blockhouses outside the town that he
hastened away as quickly as possible, and landed
at Stordalen, whence he marched, ravaging and burning,
until he reached Sweden.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> A few weeks
after Munkhaven, the other detachment of hired
troops, led by Colonel Sinclair, arrived in two Scottish
ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>But Sinclair and his men were not destined to
escape so easily as Munkhaven. The Fates ordained
that they should all, with the exception of a few, find
a grave among the mountains of Norway. The reason
why both Munkhaven and Sinclair landed in Norway,
instead of proceeding direct to Sweden, was that the
approach to the small stretch of Swedish coast on the
North Sea was closed to them after the Danes had
occupied the fortresses of Elfsborg and Gullberg, at
the mouth of the Gotha river. Moreover, the Danish
fleet had the mastery on the seas.</p>

<p>There are various statements as to the number of
the Scots that accompanied Sinclair. If the total
number of troops recruited for Sweden was, as already
mentioned, 2,200 or 2,300, of which Munkhaven
arrived with 1,400, Sinclair's corps must have
amounted to 800 or 900 men, and the latter number
is also quoted in the church register of Vaage.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Consequently,
the number could not have been 1,400, as
sung by Storm, nor 600, as stated by Slange. It is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
however, probable that Slange was right, as his statement
agrees approximately with Kruse's Report, which
says that, according to the depositions of the Bönder
"who were present at that battle, and who buried
and counted the dead and defeated, the Scots must
certainly have numbered at least 550." Less probable
appears to be the statement of the captured
Scots, to the effect that they were "350 men strong
at the utmost." One Saga says that Sinclair came
into Romsdalen with 1,400 men, and that these
were divided at Jora Bridge, in Lessö, after which
one division went over the Dovre Fjeld, and subsequently
through Österdalen, in order to unite again
with the other division which took the road through
Gudbrandsdalen. The same Saga says that the division
which went through Österdalen came across the
Norsemen at the frontier, when a battle ensued, in
which those Scots were shot down to the last man.
But that Saga is not generally current; and it appears
probable that Munkhaven's expedition, or possibly
some other event, has been mixed up in the
narrative.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It appears that Sinclair had calculated
on joining the Swedes in Southern Norway, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
however, we know from history there were no Swedes
at that time; for Jonas Ramus states<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> that, from
Gudbrandsdalen, Sinclair wanted to "unite with the
Swedes who were supposed to be in Hedemarken," or,
as stated in the entry above quoted from the Vaage
church register, at Borge Church, in Smaalenene.</p>

<p>It was on the 19th or 20th August<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> that Sinclair,
with all his hired followers, approached the Norwegian
coast, and steered into the Romsdal fiord; but
a Saga relates that before he entered that fiord he
landed on a small island on which dwelt a wealthy
man. The wife of the latter is said to have been an
intelligent and talkative woman, and Sinclair entered
into a jocose conversation with her. Although he had
not yet made known that he was an enemy, yet
the woman said she well understood the object of
his coming; that his expedition into Norway would
end badly, and that when he got inland he would
come to bite the dust on meeting the hardy men of
the glens. This enraged Sinclair, and he left the
island with the threat that when he returned victorious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>he would seek her out and have her cut to
pieces for her flippancy.</p>

<p>It is possible that this and other similar Sagas may
have induced the poet Storm to sing about a mermaid.
It is also related that the mermaid's name was Ellen.
Others say that was the name of Sinclair's wife; for
the Sagas say she accompanied him. She went on
board with the troops, in disguise, and only made
herself known after they had got out to sea. She is
said to have given birth to a child on the voyage.</p>

<p>A Bonde called Peder Klognæs, seeing from his
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Gaard</i> or farm of Klognæs,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> in the parish of Grytten,
in Romsdalen, Sinclair's ships out in the fiord, supposed
they were vessels laden with corn, took his
purse in which were three dollars, and rowed out to
them, with the object of purchasing before the vessels
reached Væblungsnæs, towards which Sinclair was
steering. As soon as Peder Klognæs got on board,
he understood what kind of folk they were; and as
they wanted to compel him to pilot the ships to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Væblungsnæs, at the head of the Romsdal fiord, he
reflected hurriedly, and soon determined what he
should do. He made them believe that the water
was too low to admit of the vessels sailing further
into the fiord, and that all they could do was to land;
and Peder Klognæs was forced to accompany them.
In order that he should not escape, they fastened a
cord to his hair and led him by it. The Scots then
disembarked at Skothammer, or Skotkleven (the
Scots' Cliff), as the place is now called, in the vicinity
of Klognæs gaard (farm). Before they proceeded any
further, Peder Klognæs, after much supplication, obtained
permission to go first into his house. Although
a guard followed him, he found an opportunity of
sending a <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Budstikke</i>,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> announcing the arrival of the
enemy, and calling upon the people to take up arms.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
He gave the letter to his servant-maid, who hid it in
one of her stockings, and dressing herself in tattered
clothes, pretended she was a beggar as well as idiotic,
and in that manner, but with difficulty, she slipped past
the Scottish watch. When the latter wanted to prevent
her from passing, she said, "Lord, bless us! it is
too hard that poor folk should not be able to go their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>way," on which the watch allowed her to pass. She
got safely to the sea-shore, and rowed to Væblungsnæs
with the letter (or <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Budstikke</i>), which was sent forward
from thence. Meanwhile Peder Klognæs led the Scots
two miles<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> out of the way, round the Iisfiord, over
mountains and marshes, and through woods in which
there were no roads, as well as over rivers where
they had to wade, so that, as Peder Klognæs had intended,
they were considerably delayed on the march.
The Bönder in the several parishes had thus time to
save themselves and also their goods from being plundered,
and time was moreover gained for the circulation
of the message.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances that Sinclair with
his Scots landed in the country in which he thought
he was going to play the part of a conqueror; for,
according to the Saga, he said that he would "recast"
the Norwegian lion into a mole which would not dare
to creep out of its hole, and he promised his men that
after the conquest of the country they would get "the
fairest maidens and the best farms." It was further
promised to them that Hedemarken would be to them
"a land of Canaan."</p>

<p>There are not many Sagas respecting the behaviour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of the Scots, and as to what occurred on their march
until they reached Gudbrandsdalen. It is, however,
related that on the circuitous and difficult way round
the Iisfiord they came to the small farm of Thorvig.
Its inhabitants had fled, and had hidden their bedding
in a cleft on the fjeld; but the Scots found it, cut
holes in it, shook out the feathers, and took the covers
with them. They arrived at last at Omdals or Aansdals-næs,
where they rested after the fatigues of going
round the Iisfiord. Here Peder Klognæs, the guide,
found an opportunity of hiding, unobserved, the three
dollars already mentioned under some birch bark,
where he found them on his return.</p>

<p>According to Kruse's Report, the Scots made two
Bönder prisoners in Romsdalen, and employed them
as guides; and Slange likewise states that they compelled
some Bönder to go in advance and tell the
peasantry to supply provisions at certain places and
at a time indicated, under threat of killing and burning
if this was not done. From Omdals-næs the
Scots marched some miles along the ordinary road up
the Romsdal. At a cottage called Aagerreiten, on the
estate of Aag, close to Omdal, a small building was
being erected. The workmen fled when they heard of
the enemy's approach. This building still stands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the date 1611 is to be seen carved on a board near
the chimney.</p>

<p>At a farm-house&mdash;it is not known which&mdash;lower
down in Romsdal, the Scots are said to have cut off
the feet of a dog which the people, who had run away,
had fastened to the door of their store-house, in order
that it might let them know when the Scots came.
At the farm of Eidet (Ödeeidet) one of the Scots is
reported to have been shot from the other side of the
river by a man who belonged to a farm called Fiva.
From the farm of Maange, a little further up in
Romsdal, the inhabitants had fled, but food had been
left placed on the table. At Rödstulen farm, a "wild
Turk," as the Saga calls him, who accompanied the
Scots, was shot. Schöning<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> relates that the Romsdal
men assembled and attacked the Scots with sticks and
stones, without, however, being able to arrest their
advance. The Saga also says that they had intended
to attack them at Maangehammer and at Skiri, as
well as at Kyllinge Klev and Björnekleven&mdash;the latter
being a mountain pass where Romsdal joins Gudbrandsdal;
but nothing came of it, as the Scots got
to those places too early, and the Romsdal men, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
lacked both arms and leaders. Sinclair therefore
advanced without hindrance, and committed
many an act of cruelty on his march. Dread and
terror were therefore connected with his name. Many
fled to the mountains, but some were seized by the
Scots. It is said that girls and young married women
were violated and then mutilated, and left in that
condition by the Scots. All they were able to find in
the way of money&mdash;silver or gold&mdash;they took with
them. Corn-fields and meadows were trodden down,
farms were burned, and so forth. Storm describes the
frightful conduct of the Scots in powerful language:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>When the Scots got to the head of the Romsdal
valley, they did not dare to keep to the road any
further, and being afraid of passing the Björnekleven
(the "Bears' Cliff"), they took to the mountains.
They probably came down again at the farm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Eneboe,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> in Lessö, Gudbrandsdalen. There is a post
at that farm on which the date 1612 is said to have
been cut as a memorial of somebody that had been
killed there by the Scots. When they got thence to
the farm of Skauge, they found that the owner and
all the other inhabitants had fled, except the owner's
grandmother, who thought she had nothing to fear on
account of her advanced age. The Scots killed the
old woman and burned the farm. A little to the south
of that farm is a plain which was and still is called
Mærrasletten, where they encamped and rested a day.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
It is further related that when they came to the farm
of Kjelshuus, in Lessö, they found a meal prepared
for them; but on leaving, they emptied a barrel of
flour out on the road, and burned the farm. The
people had fled to Lordalen, on the west side of the
Laagen.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> At Nordrehuus farm there was a stout-hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>woman called Sönnef, from Lom, married to
Nordrehuus. While the Scots were ravaging the
valley, she did not run away with the rest, but
remained, although she was pregnant; and when the
enemy came to the farm, she hid herself in a barn,
in order to put out any fire which the Scots might
kindle on their departure. She was fortunately not
discovered, nor was the farm burned down. At Bjokne
farm the house-wife had on her flight forgotten to
take with her some valuables, and therefore hurried
back to save them. As soon as she had done this,
she saw the vanguard of the Scots already approaching
the farm; but she got away safely. The man at
Töndevold<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> had intended to make a stand at once
against the Scots with the people of Lessö, but found
they were too weak. He then set out a quantity of
food and drink on his table, while he and his wife
went up an eminence opposite the farm to watch
the fate of their house. The Scots, on reaching the
farm, regaled themselves with the viands which they
found, and it is said the table on which Sinclair ate
is still preserved. After they had eaten, they searched
the house for anything that might be worth carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
away; but they only found behind the door of the
cow-house a heifer, and they cut off its legs. On
leaving, they are said to have set fire to one of the
out-houses; but it went out of itself without spreading.
Where they found food set out at farms, they
were afraid lest the Bönder had poisoned it, and
therefore they first gave their dogs to eat of it.</p>

<p>As already stated, the people fled everywhere to the
mountains. Amongst other places to which some fled
were the Sjonghöiderne (heights), from which they saw
the march of the Scots through the parish. When
the Scots saw people on the heights, it is reported
that they said they would visit those "fjeld cats"
after they had conquered the country.</p>

<p>At bridges and cross-ways their guide, Peder Klognæs,
was compelled by menaces to tell if any danger need
be apprehended, which was the right way, etc. When
they got to Bottems Bridge, at Lessö, they burned it,
as they feared that the Bönder of that district might
fall upon them in the rear; and they then marched
to the parish of Dovre. As the road seemed to be
too long to Peder Klognæs, who was still obliged to
remain with the Scots, and as he had long been tired of
their company, he is said to have found at the Kjörum
farms an opportunity of leaving them, and was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a short way on the road back when he was overtaken
and compelled by cuts and blows to go on with them.
When they thus reached Jora Bridge, a short distance
thence, the Scots were afraid that some danger might
be at hand; consequently they had the bridge examined,
and sent out spies. As they found at that
bridge two roads,&mdash;of which one went southwards,
the other eastwards,&mdash;and Peder Klognæs having
pointed out the former, which they thought was not
the right direction, they suspected him of an intention
to deceive them; therefore they hung him over the
bridge, and ducked him several times in the river,
threatening to leave him there if he did not show
them the right way. But he kept to his statement,
which was really a true one, and said, "If I were to
die here&mdash;so help me, God!&mdash;I know no other road,"
on which they drew him up and proceeded further.
Others allege that this happened at Dovre Bridge. It
is said that on their march through Dovre parish, on
a plain called Kraakvolden, below the farms of Landhem,
they held a feast in a barn (still extant in 1836),
and amused themselves with dancing. The people
who had fled to the mountains saw them dancing
there. It is also related that they here held a day of
prayer, on account of the proximity of Rosten, Bægilskleven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and "the high bridge," in order that they
might safely pass those dangerous places.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the arrival of the Scots had been reported
in the south part of Gudbrandsdalen. The
soldiers belonging to that valley were then away on
the Swedish frontier fighting the enemy. All the
troops that had been stationed in the South Fjeld
district had, in fact, been drawn away, partly to the
frontier at Bahuus Lehn, partly to the Danish army
which had invaded Sweden from Skaane.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> It was
therefore only the Bönder of that valley who could
oppose the Scots.</p>

<p>No sooner had the lensmand<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Lauritz (or Lars)
Hage,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> who lived at Hage farm, in Dovre parish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>heard of the arrival of the Scots, than he determined
to oppose their march. He quickly caused messages
to be sent to the adjoining parishes, whence they were
carried further up the valley. It is said that he came
into the church at Dovre during divine service, and
giving three knocks on the floor with his staff, said,
"Give attention! The enemy has come into the
country," on which the service was stopped, and the
people hurried out of the church. At his summons
the Bönder armed themselves and hastened to march
a Norwegian mile and a half south to the above-mentioned
cliff-road of Rosten, a little north of the
post-house of Laurgaard, in Sel. Here they halted,
and intended to await the Scots. For that purpose
they began to prepare a breast-work, or a construction
such as that which was later raised at Kringlen;
but the result of a council, at which the men of
Dovre and Lessö voted for continuing the work,
while the rest were of the opposite opinion, was that
they abandoned the work they had commenced, and
withdrew further south. But on Lauritz Hage's wise
advice, in order to delay the enemy, they first destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Rosten Bridge; and consequently, when the
Scots got to Rosten they were obliged to take to the
fjeld.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>When the Bönder got down to Sel, they combined
with a number of others, who had come from the
south, probably from Froen and Ringebo. Here they
remained for the night at Romungaard, Jörgenstad,
Olstad, and other farms,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> which then lay more in a
cluster than now. There they got hold of some
barrels of beer, and several of the Bönder gave themselves
up to carousing during the night. When the
morning came, and they had to go further, some of
the peasants would not leave their beloved ale. Others
were, however, wise enough to spike the beer-casks
by knocking in the spigots and then cutting them off
close. The carousers could therefore get no more;
otherwise they would probably have remained drinking
until the Scots came up to them. Nor were the
latter far off; for the very day on which the Bönder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>left, the Scots arrived in the evening, and took up
their quarters there for the night. The Bönder then
went one and a half mile (Norwegian) southwards,
and finally halted at Kringlen, where they determined
to await and attack the Scots. This place is situated
in Bredenbygd, in Sel's annex to Vaage parish, and is
a mountain slope, over which the road goes. At the
foot of that slope, which is in many places excessively
precipitous, flows the Laagen. At that time the road
was only a narrow path or bridle-path, but it has
since been altered and enlarged into a highway.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Moreover, the ground has undergone some change
since 1612, especially in consequence of the landslip
of 1789, when it became less precipitous. There was
also more wood then than now. The name of the
place is generally written "Kringlen," under which
designation it has become best known. On the other
hand, in the language of the common people the place
was called Kringom, or Hög Kringom.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The Bönder who there assembled were from Vaage,
Lessö, Froen, and Ringebo. Both Slange and Edv.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>Storm state that the Bönder from Lom were there
too, and it is possible that some may have been
present, perhaps, from Garmo, an annex to Lom; but
according to a very common tradition current at Lom
itself, the men of Lom, although they assembled and
marched out, did not take part in the fight. The fact
is, that the people from the southern or greater part
of Skjager annex went over the Findal Mountains,
and down again through Vaage, in order to engage
the enemy, but arrived too late. Those of the parish
of Lom proper, and of the northern part of Skjager,
also went part of the way&mdash;namely, within half a
Norwegian mile to the east of Lom Church, to a
hill in the neighbourhood of Graffer farm; but here
they began to deliberate as to what they should do,
and the result was that they returned to their several
homes, on the advice of the "lads from Skjelqvale,"<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
and more especially after considering that
the Scots would not in any case come to Lom, and
that the matter, consequently, did not concern them.
That hill is to this day called "Raadsbakken,"<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>Council Hill. In addition to the Bönder assembled
at Kringlen, the peasantry of Gusdal and Öiers took
up a position in the above-named Bægilsklev, or Bæggersklev,
in Ringebo, about five Norwegian miles to
the south of Kringlen, under the leadership of
Lauritz (or Lars) Gram, the bailie of Gudbrandsdalen,
who lived at the farm of Steig, in Froen. That position
was probably selected in order to meet the possibility
of the Scots escaping from the Bönder posted
to the north. The latter were led by Lauritz Hage,
lensmand at Dovre (in Lessö?), and Peder Randklev,
lensmand in Ringebo. According to some accounts,
Guldbrand Sejelstad, of the same parish, was also
amongst the leaders.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The Bönder now prepared at Kringlen to meet
Sinclair and his Scots. As already stated, the latter
had taken to the mountains in order to avoid Rosten,
and had descended into the valley at Horgenlien in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Nordre Sel, and taken up their quarters there for
the night, after the Bönder had retired from that
farm in the morning. Sinclair slept at Romungaard,
where are still to be found the remains of the room
he occupied, and now used as a barn.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The Bönder
in Nordre Sel had fastened oxen to the fences, in
order that the enemy should not burn down their
farms. Some say that the Scots remained a day at
Sel before they proceeded further. "Now begins
prosperity; it will be better still over in Hedemarken,"
Sinclair is reported to have said to his people.
In the morning, before he marched up from Sel, a
few hours previous to the battle at Kringlen, he is
said to have burned some powder on the palm of his
hand, in order to ascertain whether his march would
be successful or not. The smoke having gone up
against his breast, he is reported to have exclaimed,
"This day I shall suffer loss in my men, however
great that loss may be." Sinclair was accompanied
by a "Veirlöber,"<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> or hound; some called it a "Værkalv,"
others a "Vildtyrk" or "Tryntyrk",<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> "able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
detect the enemy like a hound." It could, they said,
scent "Christian blood." It is likewise related that
the thick part of its legs had been removed in order
that it might run with greater lightness. The <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Veirlöber</i>
was shot the same morning at the farm of Ödegaard.
An elderly farm labourer had remained there
in order to see what the enemy would do, and hid
himself with his steel-bow in a field of hemp; and
another, who had likewise remained behind, got into
a chimney to give the signal to the archer. After
drinking some sour milk in the dairy, the hound
came up to them. It is said that the sour milk,
together with the smell of the hemp, prevented the
nose of the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Veirlöber</i> from discovering the man who
was concealed, and whose unerring shot stretched him
on the ground, so that the sour milk "spouted out of
him." A similar <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Vildtyrk</i>, as already stated, had
been shot in Romsdalen. The Saga says it was fortunate
for the Bönder that these <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">Vildtyrker</i> had been
shot, for they were dangerous spies. It is probable
that they were nothing more than Sinclair's sleuth-hounds.
This is to be inferred both from the descriptions
given and from statements respecting the one
that was shot at Ödegaard&mdash;namely, that he ran
about in the fields and barked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The Scots then advanced from Sel. It was on the
26th August 1612,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> a day which has remained so
memorable in the history of Gudbrandsdal. It was a
Wednesday. To the strains of martial music the
whole of the Scottish force marched southwards.
Some of them hearing the cries of children on the
mountains, to which the mothers had fled, are said
to have called out in derision, "Hear the witch-cats
how they screech; when we come again we shall
visit them." But soon their mockery was to be
silenced, and their music to sound for the last time;
and the young blood now flowing in their veins was
in a few moments to stain the rocky sides of Kringlen
and the gray waters of the Laagen. Step by
step they approached the spot where this expedition
was to end so quickly and sadly. The Bönder at
Kringlen were waiting for them. Here, on convenient
places above the road, they had raised huge
breastworks, and a kind of trap of stones and timber.
The trap was laid on logs held together by means of
rope, and propped up with supports in such a manner
that when the ropes were cut and the props removed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>the logs and stones would roll down the whole hill-slope.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
The object was to let the mass fall down as
soon as the enemy got below it, and thereupon to
attack the survivors with weapons in hand. The
whole of the construction of stones and logs, as
well as the Bönder, who stationed themselves behind
that awful barricade, were concealed by leafy
branches of trees and by fir trees, so as to give the
appearance of a small wood. A small body of
Bönder concealed themselves a little to the north, and
on hearing the noise of the conflict were to have
descended into the road, to prevent the enemy from
running back. The Bönder also cut down large trees,
and made <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i> out of them, to be rolled
in the front and in the rear of the enemy along the
narrow road, in order to shut him in and prevent him
from going either forwards or backwards.</p>

<p>In a ballad older than Edvard Storm's poem, undoubtedly
composed by a Gudbrandsdal man, and of
which there are a few imperfect copies, the position of
the Bönder is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"There is a cliff in Gudbrandsdal,</p>
<p class="verse">Which is called Kringlen;</p>
<p class="verse">There lay the men of the valley,</p>
<p class="verse">In all near five hundred.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<p class="verse">Intrenching there, they built a wall,</p>
<p class="verse">And raised up stones many.</p>
<p class="verse">They lay in wait as doth a cat</p>
<p class="verse">That wants to catch a mouse."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>In order to be informed how near the Scots had
come, and thus to determine when to expect them,
they sent out, says the Saga, as a spy, a Bonde of
the name of Audon Skjenna<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> of Sel. He went direct
to Skjenna farm, and saw Sinclair reviewing his men
on the green outside that farm. When he saw them
afterwards passing over Laur Bridge, which spans
the Laagen immediately to the north of the Ulen
river, he hastened back. The Scots, however, got
sight of him, and are said to have called out, "See
how the boor is running away on a 'pert.'"<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It was
necessary for the Bönder to divert the attention of
the Scots from their ambuscade, and to ascertain
when the main force of the enemy was below it, for
that would be the time for them to begin the battle.
With the latter object one of the Bönder was ordered
to remain on an island called Storöen, in the Laagen;
and then riding on a white horse out of gunshot of
the enemy, he was to keep in a line with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>enemy's main force, or with the head of it, and when
it reached the appointed place to give notice by suddenly
turning round. Some say that, in order the
better to divert the enemy's attention, he sat backwards
on the horse; while others affirm that, with
the same object, he wound a large red plaid round
his throat and down the chest of his white horse.
Other arrangements were also made to divert the
enemy's attention. On the advice of Arne Nedre-Gunstad
from Ringebo,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> the least capable of the men
who had met there were stationed on Storöen, in
order to deceive the enemy by a feint attack, and
thereby to draw off his attention from the place
where lay the real force of the Bönder. They further
sent a girl of the name of Guri, generally called
Pillar Guri, who knew well how to blow a horn,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> to
stand on Selsjordskampen, a mountain point on the
left side of the Laagen, from which she could see the
surrounding country and the approaching enemy.
When the main force of the enemy got between her
and the place selected by the Bönder she was to
blow the horn, to attract the attention of the enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>towards the point at which she was placed, and
which was opposite to the position occupied by the
Bönder; and also to signal to the Bönder, who could
not see the enemy from their ambuscade, how far
they had advanced. It is also related that, likewise
by arrangement with the Bönder, she held hanging
down in front of her a long white scarf, which she
twisted round her arm, and by gradually shortening it
signalled to the Bönder the approach of the enemy.</p>

<p>Now came the Scots. Their advanced guard of
sixty, according to others one hundred, men, who
marched a little ahead, passed unattacked. The girl
on the mountain top did not blow her horn, but
waited for the main body. It is strange that the
advanced guard observed nothing of the Bönder.
After that came the main force of the Scots; but
the Bönder remained quiet, each ready at his post.
Among them was also Berdon or Bardum Sejelstad
of Ringebö,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> who, together with two other skilful
marksmen, was one of the leaders chosen to take aim
at Sinclair; and Berdon had stipulated that no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
should shoot before he did. The Scots thought that
the Bönder force was further in advance of them,
and expecting no attack there, approached reliantly,
and were "cheerful." As soon as they came sufficiently
near, they heard the girl play on the horn
from the mountain-top. The Scots stopped and
listened to the unusual and melancholy strains. Sinclair's
band thereupon replied to her with a march.
The girl played the same air again, and the Scots
replied a second time.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> After that began the attack
from the island. Many shots were fired, but no
bullet reached so far. A volley and then several
volleys were fired, but with the same result; and the
Scots laughed at what they thought was a cowardly
attack, and in derision lifted their hats after each
discharge. But suddenly the signal was given to the
concealed Bönder, and the scene changed. The masses
of rock and timber now tumbled down, and at the same
moment Sinclair fell at the first shot that was fired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Berdon Sejelstad had taken aim at him from behind
some pine trees; and as Sinclair was considered to be
a mighty and brave warrior, invulnerable to bullets,
Berdon, in order, as he thought, to be more certain of
success, took the silver button from the neck of his
shirt, chewed it into a lump, and loaded his gun with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
it.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Some say also that the gun missed fire the first
time. The bullet is said to have struck Sinclair in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
forehead, just over his left eye. As he fell he is said
to have exclaimed, "That is Berdon Sejelstad's arquebuse."<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
The place where he fell is still called "Sinclar's
Dokken." Immediately after the colonel had
fallen it went badly with the rest; and the Bönder
threw themselves forward with courage and speed,
spreading fear and death by shooting with rifles and
hewing with axes. The position of the Scots was
bad in the highest degree; for the narrow pass in
which they were crowded, and the declivity of the
mountain on which they stood, admitted of no battle-array.
From north and south, and from above them,
the Bönder fell upon the Scots with fury. The above-mentioned
ballad says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"They were surrounded south and north&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">Which they must most have regretted:</p>
<p class="verse">There was committed upon them a miserable murder." ...</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">They attempted to run up the mountain to close
with the Bönder, but were hurled down. "Those
who were not shot jumped into the river to save
themselves, but were there drowned; and those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>them who got alive over the river were quickly killed
by the Bönder on that side."<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The girl on the mountain crag continued to play her
horn during the battle, until she saw the Laagen dyed
with blood. She then threw the horn over her head,
went away, and changed her song into weeping. Some
say that Sinclair's wife was also killed in the fight, together
with her child. According to tradition, when the
rest went to battle, Kjel Fjerdingreen<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> of Hedalen, a
parish annexed to Vaage, was persuaded by his sweetheart,
who had a foreboding of misfortune, to remain
behind; but when she heard that Sinclair's wife was
with him, and that she carried a new-born babe, she became
anxious about her fate, and as much as she had
previously bid him remain behind, she now bade him go,
not to take part in the carnage, but, if possible, to save
the child. "You shall not gain my hand, Kjel," she is
said to have told him, "before you have saved the child."
He therefore accompanied the others. In the tumult
of the battle, Kjel rushed forward in order to comply
with the touching entreaties of his sweetheart. The
child had just been hit by a ball. Kjel found Mrs.
Sinclair, who was beside herself with grief, on horseback,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and stanching the blood of her child. As he
was going to take it (others say that it had fallen
from her, she having dropped it in her fright, and
that Kjel took it up and handed it to her), she thought
he wanted to injure it, and impelled by fear and
motherly affection she thrust a dagger into her benefactor's
breast. Others say she stuck the dagger into
his back as he was stooping to take the child. It is
said that one of Kjel's companions then shot Mrs.
Sinclair down from her horse, and that her body
was afterwards seen in the Laagen. It is stated by
others that the Bönder threw her into the Laagen,
taking her for a witch, and that she sat (on the
water) stanching the blood of her child, and that the
Laagen bore her a long way before she was drowned.
When the child was killed, and before Mrs. Sinclair
fell a prey to the waves, she is said to have struck up
a wild song in her despair,&mdash;others say in her scorn.
The place where she remained for some moments on
the surface of the water is said to have been immediately
opposite to the most northerly point of Kringlen.
Others again say that she was afterwards amongst the
prisoners, and that her life was spared. The inscription
in the parish register of Vaage<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> states that she survived.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>The battle probably took place from a little north
of that point to a little south of the highest part of
Kringlen, where the wooden post stands. According
to Kruse's Report, it lasted an hour and a half. As
soon as the battle was over and the victory gained, the
Bönder went after the men of the vanguard, whom
they had allowed to pass unhindered. These had
fled forward when they perceived the defeat of the
rest; but they were overtaken on a plain at Solhjem
farm, a little to the south of Kringlen. As the
Bönder came rushing to the attack with the cry,
"Fall to! fall to! here are more of them," and the
Scots saw "what would result from it," they at once
sent their interpreter forward and said they would
surrender as prisoners. Thereupon they laid down
their arms; but when they saw that the Bönder were
not so many as they had at first thought, they took
their arms up again and wanted to fight their way
through; but they were now met in such a manner
that they were all either shot and cut down or taken
prisoners. Peder Klognæs the guide was with the
vanguard, and nearly shared its fate; but on the cry,
"I am Peder Klognæs, I am Peder Klognæs, and am
one of your own people," he escaped, and returned
later in safety to his home in Romsdalen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The strength of the Bönder force which fought at
Kringlen was between four hundred and five hundred
men,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> of whom six were killed and some few wounded.
According to the ballad&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"When the Dalesmen this had done,</p>
<p class="verse">And thus destroyed the foe,</p>
<p class="verse">I have been told of a truth</p>
<p class="verse">That six of them were killed</p>
<p class="verse">In the battle on the cliff;</p>
<p class="verse">And there were stretched as corpses,</p>
<p class="verse">Beside those who wounded were,</p>
<p class="verse">Who are but few to mention."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Bönder proceeded at once with the prisoners
to Qvam, a parish annexed to Froen. After the glory
just acquired, the Bönder committed next day a sanguinary
deed, which the inhabitants of the valley
now speak of with abhorrence, wishing it had never
been done. "The principal men among those who
were there" wished indeed that the prisoners, whom
they had confined in a barn at Klomstad farm, should
all be conveyed to Agershuus.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"But this pleased not the Dalesmen</p>
<p class="verse">That they should thus take them</p>
<p class="verse">Through the long and narrow way,</p>
<p class="verse">And give the country trouble."</p>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>The majority shouted that the prisoners should all
lose their lives, on which, so strong was the general
exasperation, they took them out of the barn,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> one by
one, and shot them all, except eighteen or some few
more. Five or six whom, owing, it is said, to "magic
art," the shots would not affect, were put to death with
pikes. The "Ballad of the Valley" says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"They minded neither lead nor powder,</p>
<p class="verse">It dried upon their brows;</p>
<p class="verse">So tough was their flesh and their skin</p>
<p class="verse">That lead could not through them go.</p>
<p class="verse">Through cunning and magic art,</p>
<p class="verse">Which they learned to a nicety,</p>
<p class="verse">What was done to them was in vain,&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">They did not even hiccough;</p>
<p class="verse">So (the Bönder) took to their sharp pikes,</p>
<p class="verse">And had to run them through;</p>
<p class="verse">Then both skin and flesh were torn,</p>
<p class="verse">And they made an end of them.</p>
<p class="verse">But of the prisoners there were spared,</p>
<p class="verse">I know, one less than twenty.</p>
<p class="verse">Amongst them were two captains&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">I will not tell a lie&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">The one Captain Bruce by name,</p>
<p class="verse">The other Captain Ramsey."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Kruse writes respecting the prisoners:&mdash;"On the
day the battle took place one hundred and thirty-four
Scots were taken prisoners, who were straightway the
next day killed and shot by the Bönder, with the exception
of the above-named eighteen, the Bönder saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to each other that his Royal Majesty had enough to feed
in those same eighteen. Some of these were, however,
wounded, and some had bullets in their bodies when
they arrived here.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Of the above-mentioned eighteen
soldiers we now send to you<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> the three principal
ones, who are a captain of the name of Alexander Ramsay,
and his lieutenant of the name of Jacob Mannepenge
[James Moneypenny], who has previously been
both in Denmark and Sweden, and who on this their
expedition served as an interpreter; the third is called
Herrich Bryssz [Henry Bruce], who, according to his
own statement, has served as a soldier in Holland,
Spain, and Hungary. As regards the remaining fifteen
persons, some of them have straightway taken service
among good folk here in the country, and some who
will willingly serve your Royal Majesty in Jörgen
Lunge's<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> regiment, I sent at once to Elfsborg." This
is alluded to as follows in the Valley Ballad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"They were then to the castle brought,</p>
<p class="verse">No desire had they to remain....</p>
<p class="verse">They could not relish the fare so hard</p>
<p class="verse">Which the Gudbrandsdal men gave&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">Here are not many hens or sheep&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">But lead and powder they got in their insides."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>That at least eighteen remained alive can thus be
seen from Kruse's Report, and, moreover, that some
few remained behind in the valley is recorded by
tradition. Storm sings that none of the Scots ever
saw their own country again. Nevertheless it is related
of at least one of them that "he came home."<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
The place in Qvam parish where the Scots killed at
the barn were buried, is still shown a little to the
north of the barn, and is called Skothaugen ("The
Scot hillock").</p>

<p>The conduct of the Bönder towards their prisoners
can certainly not in any way be justified; but so long
as there is much that can be pleaded in extenuation,
we should, on the other hand, be cautious in pronouncing
an unqualified condemnation. According to tradition,
they were excited to that deed by Peder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Klognæs, who had seen so many cruelties committed
by the Scots on the way, and who had himself suffered
so much at their hands. It can be imagined that the
real state of the case was possibly this: the Bönder,
weary after a march of several days, and after the
last day's work and fighting, came to Qvam with
their prisoners, when they began, it may be supposed,
to be weary of leading them further. It was the
busy harvest time; they were possibly short of provisions.
Perhaps some of them had a debauch, as
previously at Sel, and excited by liquor as well as by
the account of the cruelties of the Scots, they considered
the latter worthy of death, and quickly set to
work to slaughter them, notwithstanding that the
principal men had opposed such a proceeding. (See
<em>ante.</em>) It may be that the prisoners themselves had
given them fresh cause for exasperation during their
conveyance or while they were being guarded; and
such a supposition is all the more within the range
of possibility, since it is otherwise very singular that
the Bönder did not kill their prisoners immediately
after the affair at Solhjem (since their exasperation
was so great on the following day), but conducted
them one mile and a half (Norwegian) on the way
to Agershuus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Special circumstances, no longer known, may have
occurred as contributory reasons for such conduct.
Moreover, before pronouncing judgment on the inhabitants
of Gudbrandsdal, we must remember that
wars at that time, and the Calmar War as a whole,
were conducted with much cruelty, and we must
take into consideration the spirit of the age. Nor
should we forget that more than two centuries lie
between them and us. A far higher stage of culture
has been attained of later years, and yet they have
produced not a few examples of similar barbarity.
We have only to remember what is related respecting
the cruelty of the Duke of Cumberland in 1746 after
the battle of Culloden in Scotland, General Moreno's
murder of General Torrejos and his sixty comrades in
misfortune on the plains before Malaga in 1832,
General Minas's cruelty at Lacaroz in 1835, and the
cruelties of the Carlists towards the English prisoners
at Tolosa in 1837, etc.</p>

<p>Respecting one of the Scottish prisoners who remained
alive, tradition relates that when he saw a
musket being aimed at him he ran to Ingebrikt
Valde<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> of Vaage, and with pitiful gesticulations asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>for life and protection, seeking shelter under his
horse; whereupon Ingebrikt lifted his axe in defence
of the man, threatening to cut down any one
who killed him. That Scot is said to have been a
glazier, and to have subsequently settled in the
country. As a token of his gratitude he sent some
windows to Ingebrikt Valde, whom in his letters he
always called his "life's father." Of these windows
one is still to be seen at Valde farm.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Some lines,
burnt into one of the panes, form a shield, on which
are seen a figure like a crest (perhaps Ingebrikt
Valde's seal or signature) and an angel with hands
held protectingly over it. Another of the prisoners
remained in Vaage, where he got a piece of land to
cultivate, and which clearing is now a farm called
Skotlien.</p>

<p>Either at the engagement at Kringlen or during the
affair at Solhjem one of the Scots is said to have saved
himself by swimming over the Laagen, whence he took
to the mountains. In the evening (the mountains
being only a Norwegian mile across) he came down to
Ellingsbö farm in Hedalen, and his appearance bespoke
fright and hunger. The farmer, who, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Gram's Census, was called Christian, placed food before
him. While the Scot sat and ate the mowers came
home. At the sight of those men and their scythes
he thought they were some of those who had been
at Kringlen, so he jumped up and showed signs of
fear lest his life should be taken; but the Bonde
soon quieted him. The Scot remained there four
years, went to Oslo,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> where he settled as a goldsmith,
and sent as a present to his benefactor at Ellingsbö

<p>From one of the prisoners, who is said to have
been a cardmaker, and who married in the country, a
family with the surname of Matheson is descended,
and several of its members still reside in the province
of Trondhjem.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Among the prisoners was also a woman, whom Lars
Hage afterwards met at the house of a merchant at
Oslo. He recognized her, and she him. The merchant
told her to draw a jug of ale for the man. But as he
would not drink, she said, "Drink, good man, I have
done you no harm;" and the merchant having asked
her, "Do you know to whom you are offering that
good ale?" she replied, "I know him well enough.

<p>A prisoner who had been quartered at Veikle farm
in Qvam parish, and who had been well treated, sent
later, says tradition, "when he got home," six silver
spoons to the farmer,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> as a token of remembrance.
Respecting two other prisoners, one of whom was at a
farm in Qvam, the other at a farm in Sel, it is related
that they were shot the same autumn, "as the proprietors
did not find it would pay them to feed them
over the winter." Another of the prisoners is said to
have been killed at Vaage. The farmer with whom he
lived took him on a journey into the woods. On the
way, it is said, they began to talk about the battle at
Kringlen. The prisoner having said that if the Scots had
known about the Bönder as much as the latter had known
of them matters would have turned out differently, the
farmer got angry and cut his prisoner down on the spot.</p>

<p>It is related of the Bönder from Vaage that on the
return homewards they met at Kalsteen, in Vaage, a
portion of the men of Lom who intended to encounter
the Scots. An argument arose between the men of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>Vaage, proud of victory, and those of Lom, and a
bloody battle very nearly ensued, but it was prevented
by individual representations. A certain Peder
Killie<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> of Dovre is reported to have said on his return
home from the battle that he thanked God he had not
fired a shot at the Scots; but when another Bonde,
his neighbour, heard this, he became angry, quickly
cocked his gun to shoot him, and would have killed
him had not others intervened and prevented him.</p>

<p>A man called, Jörgen Fjerdingreen<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> of Hedalen is
said to have got possession of Sinclair's money-chest
(or holster), and was carrying it home on a pack-horse.
At Breden farm he went inside to enjoy himself; but
spending a long time over his dinner, the holster, which
he had left outside, was carried away.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> This has given
rise to the saying, which, however, is not very general,
"to dine like Jörgen."</p>

OLD MONUMENT OVER SINCLAIR'S GRAVE.
<p class="rightx padr4"><em><a href="#Page_121">Page 121</a>.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Sinclair's body was carried to Qvam and there buried
just outside the church-yard, as the exasperated
Bönder would not allow him to lie in consecrated
ground. It is told that one of his relatives thought
he had not been killed, but only taken prisoner, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>therefore came to Norway in search of him, but found
only his grave. A simple wooden post close to the
road, a little to the south of the church,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> shows to
this day where he lies buried. A board with the following

<p>On the spot where Sinclair and his Scots fell, a
monument was also raised in commemoration of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>event. In lieu of the stone pillar which, according to
Slange, had the inscription, "Here was Colonel George
Sinclair shot the 26th August, anno 1612," the present
post was raised in 1733, on the occasion of King
Christian the Sixth's journey to Trondhjem. The
monument, which stands under the shadow of a birch
tree on the top of the hill beside the road, and a few
paces to the south of the spot where Sinclair was shot,
is in the form of a simple wooden cross, with a board
on which the inscription is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet another post in commemoration of the battle
was set up by a private individual in the year 1826,
a little to the north of Kringlen, at the farm of Pladsen
or Söudre (South) Kringlen. It is about five feet
high, of soapstone, and in the form of an obelisk surmounted
by a ball. This monument will be set up in
a more appropriate place when the road is altered.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>

hemlock<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cicuta virosa s. aquatica</i>), which is very
poisonous, and which grows in great quantities in a
marsh at Nordre (North) Sel, dates, according to
tradition, from the time of the Scots. It is said the
Scots sowed that herb; but that this has only been
attributed to them out of hatred need scarcely be
added. On an islet opposite Kringlen stood, until the
great flood of 1789, a large fir tree, in the trunk of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>which some musket balls, as well as many traces of
them, were to be found, and some years ago human
bones were found where the wooden cross now stands.
Various weapons and other things still remain after
the Scots in many parts of the valley. Thus at the
farm of Mælum in Bredebygd is a drum, which is
called the "Scots' drum." It was brought thirty or
forty years ago from Ringebo, where it was likewise
known under the same name.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> At Nordre Bue farm
are a musket and a sword which belonged to the
Scots. At the farm of Söudre Kringlen or Pladsen a
spur and a knife were found a short time ago on the
hill where the battle took place. In the parish of
Vaage, at Lunde farm, is a dirk which had belonged
to the Scots. There is also a dirk at Kruke farm
in Hedalen, and this is said to be the one with which
Mrs. Sinclair stabbed Kjel Fjerdingreen. According
to an English traveller who has seen them, these dirks
are similar to those still carried by a regiment in
Scotland which is armed in the old style. At Fjerdingreen
farm is a purse made of steel-wire rings, also
a large and a small powder-horn, which are said to
have belonged to Colonel Sinclair. In the parish of
Dovre, at the farm of Ödegaarden, is preserved a chest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>bound with iron, which is said to have been Sinclair's
money-chest, as well as a large and a small powder-horn,
also reported to have belonged to him. There is likewise
a powder-horn at the farm of Sönstebö, in the
parish of Læssö. Among the things that belonged to
Sinclair, Peder Klognæs is said to have got a pair of
snuffers, which he took home with him, and which
are said to be still preserved at Mandalen farm in
Romsdalen. In the Armoury of the fortress of Agershuus<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
are preserved muskets<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> which had belonged to
the Scots. In the Museum at Bergen are the stock of
a pistol and a powder-horn, and in the Museum of the
University of Christiania the stock of a pistol inlaid
with ivory&mdash;all relics of the Scots. Sinclair's pistols
are kept in the Museum at Copenhagen. They are
described as follows in the catalogue of the Museum:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the close of the last century, a Count Laurvig

C. R. Thott his musket, which was for a long period
preserved in the family of Berdon Sejelstad, who, as
the slayer of Sinclair, got it as his booty. At the

owned Sinclair's fighting sword, which he gave away
to be sent to the Art Museum at Copenhagen.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Just as Christian IV. punished severely the nobleman
Steen Bilde and the men of Stordalen and Jemtland
for having made no opposition to Colonel Munkhaven
on his march through the country to Sweden,
so was the conduct of the men of Gudbrandsdal, differing
as it did from that of the others, not allowed by
the king to pass unrewarded. By letters-patent, dated
from the Castle of Frederiksborg, September 3, 1613, he
gave to Lars Hage the farm (Hage) which he occupied, together
with the farm of Landnem; to Peder Randklev
the farm (Nedre Randklev) on which he lived, together
with the farm of Gundestad; and to Berdon Sejelstad
likewise the farm he occupied (Övre Sejelstad);&mdash;"to
them and their descendants in perpetual possession, for
their fidelity, diligence, and manliness in the late war."<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The descendants both of Lars Hage<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and of Peder
Randklev still live; but the family of Berdon Sejelstad
is said to have died out, at all events at the farm
where he lived&mdash;namely, Övre Sejelstad. Gulbrand
lived at Nedre Sejelstad, and the present occupant of
the farm is his fifth descendant in a direct line.</p>

<p>According to Hjorthöi's account (part ii., pp. 7, 135,
137, and 138), Arne Gunstad, whom he calls the next
in command of the Bönder (from Ringebo?), and who,
according to tradition, distinguished himself by his
bravery and extraordinary strength, was rewarded by
the exemption of his farm from the assessment called
"Foring." The same immunity was granted to Lars
Hage, Peder Randklev, and Berdon Sejelstad, in respect
of their several farms; and that freedom from
taxation is enjoyed by those farms to this day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>According to tradition, Audon or Ingebrikt Skjenna of
Sel also received as a reward of his bravery the gift
of the farm of Sel, of which the present occupiers are
said to be his descendants. The girl Guri, says tradition,
had the farm of Rindal in Vaage, subsequently
called Pillarvigen, given to her as a recompense.</p>

<p>The battle at Kringlen<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> will ever remain a remarkable
event in our history. It is certainly not
remarkable on account of the number of the combatants
or the magnitude of the defeat, but for the
<em>manner</em> in which the enemy was annihilated. It
was <em>Bönder</em> led only by <em>Bönder</em> who, with <em>presence of
mind</em>, knew how to select excellent ground, utilized it
with sagacity to carry out in harmony a plan of attack
that had been decided upon, and who fell with such
courage on a superior enemy. Moreover, the event will
serve to increase the series of examples which history
has preserved to us, of how dangerous it is for an
enemy to penetrate far into a mountainous country.</p>

error, as must also be the name of Hans, instead of Lars, as he is called in the
Sagas, and perhaps as he was called in familiar language, or Lauritz, as he is
named in Kruse's Report and in Christian Fourth's Deed of Gift, and as he
wrote it himself in a letter still kept at Tofte farm, in the parish of Dovre.
In Gram's Census he is entered as Lauritz Hage, which was probably considered
to have a more distinguished sound than Lars Hage. However,
the name Lars does not occur anywhere in that Census, and "Lauritz" is
everywhere substituted for it. The bailie Gram also signs himself in the
Census not Lars, but "Lauritz," which is also the name on his seal.</p></div>

or because the road between the farms to the south and north goes <em>round</em>
("omkring") the crags that are there; for in olden days the word "omkring"
(around) was, as it still partly is, in the language of the Bönder, "kringum."
Likewise in old Norwegian the word "Kringla" meant a circle, a curve.</p></div>

The men of Lom are often to this day reproached by the other
inhabitants of Gudbrandsdal for having gone back from Raadsbakken.
Hjorthöi, in his "Description of Gudbrandsdalen" (Beskrivelse af Gudbrandsdalen),
part ii., page 67, says that the word "Löer," which was
likewise applied to them, originated from their having "lingered so long
on Raadsbakken;" and he thinks that "Löer" is synonymous with Löi&mdash;that
is, slothful, indolent, or dilatory in coming forward. But this
conjecture is scarcely right, for "Lö" undoubtedly comes from the
ancient name of the district&mdash;Lo, Loar (see Snorre Sturleson); moreover,
the men of Lom tolerate their being called "Löer," which they certainly
would not do if any disgrace attached to the appellation.</p></div>

be that some of the original notes will be found in "Sinclair's March," and
possibly the true "Sinclair March" may be found in Scotland; for it is
credible that Colonel Sinclair made use of the pipe music of the Sinclair
clan, and although the clans have long been broken up, there are still a
great number of pipers over the whole of the north part of Scotland who
know well all the old melodies, and transmit them from generation to
generation.

But in this respect he merits less credence than Kruse or the Sagas.
Slange says also that "one of the prisoners was a glazier, who established
himself in Norway and died there; while the other was sent to Scotland."
This is also related in the Sagas; but that the latter was sent home "to
tell his countrymen how it happened," is doubtless an addition made by
Slange himself. To illustrate in how distorted a manner many of the
later historians describe the incident at Kringlen, it may be mentioned
as an example, among several others, that Fred. Sneedorff, in his
lectures on the "History of the Fatherland," vol. ii., p. 106, and later
even, Werlauff in the fourth edition, p. 191, of Munthe's "Pictures of

possibly point to a family connection between him and the Danish nobleman
Anders (Andrew) Sinclar, who in 1607 emigrated from Scotland to
Denmark, where his race died out at the end of the seventeenth century.
Moreover, persons of that name lived in Norway a couple of centuries
before the arrival of George Sinclair: thus David Sinclar is named as a
civil officer of high rank at Bergen in 1416; and Anders Sinclar as a chief
commander in Bohuus Castle from 1461 to 1464; and Aaseline, daughter
of Henry Sinclar of Sanneberg, who was married to Anders van Bergen
of Onerheim farm in Söndhordlehn, who at the close of the fifteenth
century was a Norwegian Councillor of State ("Samlinger til det Norske
Folksprog og Historie," vol. iii., p. 576). In addition to a Captain
Sinclar, who is named in 1645, there is also mention, as being in this country
in the seventeenth century, of one David Sinclar, who was on the
2nd August 1669 appointed by King Frederick III. Bailie of Eger or
Lier, and who held the farm of Sem in Eger as tenant under the Crown;
as also a Gregers Sinclar, who was undoubtedly related to the Sinclar
just named, and who in 1688 lived at Vestfossen in Eger, where in that
year, at the farm of Hals, he caused copper-works, with a smelting-house
and stamping-mill, to be erected, but which, after working unsuccessfully
for four years, he was obliged to abandon. Even at the end of the last
century persons of the name of Sinclar resided in this country (Kraft's
"Norges Beskr," part ii., pp. 406, 407; Ström's "Egers Beskr," p. 56; and
documents in the State Archives and in the Archives of the Municipality
of Christiania). It would, however, be difficult, in the absence of historical
information, to decide how far any of the above-mentioned persons
were related to each other, or whether any of them were descended from
the noble Scottish family of Sinclair, as there was a whole clan of that
name in Scotland. The Andrew (Anders) Sinclar above-mentioned may
have belonged to that family, from which also the various Swedish noble
families of that name are said to have derived their origin. Francis (Frants)
Sinclar was the first of that name who was raised, in 1649, to the order of
Swedish knighthood and nobility. (See Stjernman's "Register of Swedish
Knighthood and Nobility," part i., pp. 425, 516, and 710, and p. 22, part iii.)
</p>
<p>
The Scottish noble family of Sinclair or St. Clair is of Norman origin,
but it came originally from St. Clair in France, whence William St.
Clair&mdash;a son of Walter, Earl of St. Clair, and Margaret, daughter of
Richard, Duke of Normandy&mdash;emigrated in the twelfth century to Scotland,
where he acquired extensive lands in Midlothian. The possessions
of his descendants increased considerably under the munificence of
the Kings of Scotland, especially during the reign of Robert Bruce,
and embraced at last the baronies of Roslyn, Pentland, Cowsland, Catcune,
and others. One of the same William St. Clair's descendants in
a direct line&mdash;namely, Henry St. Clair (de Sancto Claro)&mdash;was in 1379
made, by King Hakon VI. of Norway, Jarl or Earl of the Orkney
Islands, which were then under the suzerainty of the kingdom of Norway,
and his family held that dignity until the year 1471, when by an
Act of Parliament the Orkney Islands were annexed to the Scottish
Crown, and in compensation for the same, William St. Clair, then Earl
of Orkney and Earl of Caithness, received from King James III. the
Castle of Ravensheuch, of which the ruins, still in existence, belong to
the Earls of Roslyn, who represent a branch of the St. Clair family.
According to Stjernman, the Earl of Orkney (<em>vide</em> "Catalogus Comitum
Orcadensium" in the "Orkneyinga Saga," Havniæ, 1780) used as his motto
the word "Fight." As adherents of the House of Stuart, the St. Clair
family lost its lands and was obliged to wander in exile. As is well
known, Walter Scott has described the tragical fate of the family in the
sixth canto of his "Lay of the Last Minstrel." The family is, however,
widely spread in Scotland, and the noble Swedish family of the same
name is said to be descended from the St. Clairs of Freswick and Dunbeath.
Although there is no historical certainty that George Sinclair,
who fell at Kringlen, was also descended from the noble Scotch family of
St. Clair, yet it is very probable that such was the case.</p></div>

"Sinclair pistols" at Copenhagen. The initials on them must be those
of Anders or "Sir Andrew" Sinclair. Many of his letters to Robert,
Earl of Salisbury, written between 1607 and 1621, are in the Public
Record Office, London. In 1607, while in the service of the King of
Denmark, he received £1,000 from King James I.; and in 1610 he urged
Lord Salisbury to send him his pension, and also to obtain a loan from
King James, as he had bought lands in Denmark of the value of forty
thousand crowns, part of which he still owed. In 1610 he asked Lord
Salisbury to be godfather and to give his Christian name to a son born in
that year, his two elder sons having been named James and Christian.
In 1611 he was made governor of the castle and town of Calmar. He
was sent as ambassador to England in 1621. There was evidently no
direct connection between him and George Sinclair, whose descent has

<p><a name="Footnote_134" id="Footnote_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_134"><span class="label">[134]</span></a> In a letter, dated Österaad, December 20, 1651, and preserved in the State
Archives of Norway, Chancellor Ove Bjelke recommends the Norwegian
Stadtholder Iver Krabbe to help a "Peder Eckre, formerly lensmand in
Dovre," to obtain justice in a certain cause. He writes that he had "known
his father, who was the man that had beaten Hr. Georgium Sincklar, who
wanted to lead the Scottish folk through Gudbrandsdalen." In Gram's
Census is named as a tenant at Lessö, in addition to Lauritz (Lars) Hage, also
a Lauritz Eckre; but it is not improbable that Lars Hage had also the lease
of Ekre, and consequently the two persons would be identical. In the latter
case, it may be assumed that Peder Ekre was a son of Lars Hage, who may
have inherited the farm of Ekre and the office of lensmand from his father.
There is no doubt that Peder Ekre is the lensmand of that name who
(according to Hjorthöi, part ii., p. 7) received from the Crown the farm of
Hundenæs in Lessö for his "loyalty and diligence" at the siege of Trondhjem
in the year 1658; and if this is so, he was a brave son of a brave father.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_135" id="Footnote_135"></a><a href="#FNanchor_135"><span class="label">[135]</span></a> In addition to the <em>poetical</em> treatment of the event by Edvard Storm in
the romance which is so popular for its "Homeric <em>naïveté</em>," it has been treated
<em>dramatically</em> by K. L. Rahbek under the title of "Skottekrigen eller Bondebrylluppet
i Gudbrandsdalen" (The Scottish War; or, The Bonde Wedding
in Gudbrandsdalen). It was published separately (Copenhagen, 1810), and is
also to be found in the collection of his plays, vol. ii., pp. 1-83. The event is
also the subject of a tragedy by Henry Wergeland, "Sinclars Död" (Sinclair's
Death), Christiania, 1828; and J. St. Wang's novel, "Skottertoget
eller Slaget ved Kringen" (The Scottish Expedition; or, The Battle of
Kringen), two volumes, Christiania, 1836 and 1837, is founded upon it.</p></div></div>

<p>Moreover Sir, they heire are much greeved against Scottis
men, in regairde of some Scottis shippes, that have nowe of
late fallen in, In Norroway,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and done great hurt unto the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
inhabitants there, and taken sindrie shippes out of theire
havens, which the Dunkirkers never did in tyme of warre:
the one shippe is found to have been the Erle of Orknayis,
for shee was a flybotte of Dunkerke, that he had, and one
Stewart is Captane of herre; ther is another shippe in the
companie whois captaine is also named Stewart; and they
have a thirde shippe the Captane wherof is a Hollander:
and the fourth is a pryse that they have taken: they have
beene the first, thirde and fyft of Juin, in sundrie harbreis of
Norroway; I have myself reade the letters sent hither to
the Chancellor, with havie complaints against them. They
heere doe beleeve certainely, that they have commission, ather
from Wormistoun, or els from S<sup>r</sup> Robert Stewart, wich I have
protested instantlie against, assuring them that if such a
thing be with there consent, they never darre looke yo<sup>r</sup> M<sup>tie</sup>
in the face. In lyk maner this last winter, at my being
heere in Denmark in that great defaitte that Gustavus had,
there was a Skots Ansient<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> taken prisoner when there was
no quarter kept amongst them, whois name is Pryngle; the
King wpone my most humble suit, and by meanes of the
Chancellor, sett him at libertie, in regard that he was your
M<sup>is</sup> subject, as he hath done sindrie others: this Pringle,
efter he had given his oathe and a reversse taken under his
hand, that he should never goe to Sweden, nather serve
against the King of Denmark, he is now taken againe, in a
shippe going to Sweden, and I am almost ashamed to speek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
any more, in his behalfe; with such things I ame oft met
heere: as also with thir Inglish mariners sindrie discontent.
So I humblie crave your M<sup>tie</sup> pardone, for trowbling of your
M<sup>tie</sup> with thir Idle matters, but they being used as arguments
against me in conference, I thought good to lett your

he have been told by ther frendes that they desired
to serve the King of Sweeden in Muscovy and they should
be farre from annoying the King of Denmarke yet was not
his Ma<sup>ty</sup> satisfied therwith but hath sent to forbidde them,
accompting it all one to serve the King of Sweden there or
neerer to Denmarke for that it should but enable him to
use the greater force against the King of Denmarke. And
this his Ma<sup>ty</sup> doth out of memory of his promise to the King

be the first reporter of it himselfe by you his Minister there
and his pleasure therefore is that you take the first opportunity

<p>The King of Denmark is informed, that one Menigowe a
fleeming, haveing in companie with him fyfteen hundreth men,
is to meet with Androw Ramsay, in some pairt of the North
of Scotland, about Caithness, or Orknay, who hath in lyk
maner moe than a thowsand Scottis men with, and so they
mynd to joine their forces togither, and to fall upon Norroway,
and spoile some towns, and so to goe into Sweden. The
King of Denmark doeth much mervaile theirat, in regaird
of that letter which your M<sup>tie</sup> sent wnto him, when Sir
Robert Stewart, and Maister Ramsay went first into Sweden:
whereby your M<sup>tie</sup> desyred, that they might pass
saively, for particulairs of their owne; and that their going
shuld in no wayis prejudge the King of Denmark: notwithstanding
Maister Ramsay being come to Sweden, maid offer
of his service to the Prince and State of Sweden: and coming
owt againe, had letters and directions to my Lord of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Wormeston, which he did throw in the sea, being taken
prisoner by the King of Denmarks ships, and browght unto
the King, and examined upon his oathe if he had any commission
for leveing of men, for the King of Swedens wss, or
if he intended to goe bak againe to serve him: all which he
then flatly denyed, and did sweare that he shuld never
serve against Denmark; wherewpon he was dismissed, with
a saveconduict to goe through the King of Denmarks dominions.
Notwithstanding of this, the King of Denmark
is certainly informed by men comed owt of Scotland, that he
hath leveed men about Eden<sup>gh</sup> and imbarked them at Leeth:
And moreover his M<sup>tie</sup> tould me of a particular man that wes
killed in Leith by one of his companie, which caused a great
sturre amongst some noble men, and the towne of Leith.
His M<sup>tie</sup> wsed this speech as an argument to prove, that such
leveis, and imbarkements so neere to Eden<sup>bh</sup> could not be
done without permission of the State: whereto I answered,
that I beleeved certainly, that these leveis were not, by any
authoritie of your M<sup>tie</sup> or the State, but only voluntarie men,
of whom the cuntry is full, for want of Imployment.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> And
moreover I called his M<sup>tie</sup> to mynd, that 10 yeers agoe when
William Ogilvye, and 6 yeers agoe when Wormeston went
over in tyme of peace betwixt Denmark and Sweden: notwithstanding
I know perfytly, that none of them had licence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>to lift wp men, without express command of your M<sup>tie</sup> that
they shuld never Imploy themselves, or their men, against
the crowne of Denmark; farre more easily his M<sup>tie</sup> myght
beleeve that now in tyme of warres y<sup>r</sup> M<sup>tie</sup> would give leave
to no subject of yours, to goe serve against him: I perceave
by the Kings speeches if they come in his hands, they
shall runne a great hasard.</p>

<p>As for the Scottishmen gon into Sweeden; wee hope that
by o<sup>r</sup> Lres by Quarryer w<sup>ch</sup> wilbe w<sup>th</sup> yo<sup>w</sup> before these, the
King will have receaved <span class="screenonly">satisfac̅c̅o̅n̅</span><span class="handonly">satisfa{ccon}</span> in that matter. And as
wee wrote then, wee wold bee curious to informe ourself, how
that cold be, considering o<sup>r</sup> order given to the contrary, when
o<sup>r</sup> Secretary of Scotland shold be come, who was then upon
the way, soe have wee upon his arrivall made very straight
enquiry of the passage of that matter, and cannot find other
then this; That as heretofore upon our first entring into
this Kingdome, the Earle Hume and some others did Levye
some men for the Archdukes service (though making us
privately acquainted w<sup>th</sup> it) yet having no publique warrant
nor striking any drumme, but only passing them in silence;
Soe now the Captens of this Levye did by that example suppose
to themselves; that usuing the same privie maner of
proceeding w<sup>th</sup>out drumme or Ensigne displayed (though
not making us acquainted w<sup>th</sup> it) they might without
offence have caryed away such as they cold move voluntarily
to goe; the rather, for that they protest they had
no purpose to serve against the King of Denmarke,
but to be employed in Muscovia; a misconceipt of theires
w<sup>ch</sup> wee doe no wayes allowe; for indeed it is all one, as if
they did, seeing their serving the King of Sweeden in that
part doth but enable him to be the stronger against Denmarke.
And o<sup>r</sup> said Secretary doth further assure us upon
his creditt w<sup>th</sup> us; that the Levye was so closely caryed, as
that untill o<sup>r</sup> Lres came to o<sup>r</sup> Councell of Scotland for the
stay of them; he had never for himselfe heard of any such
thing to be in hand; He doth further adde that it is likely;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that Andrew Ramsey being the cheif of the buisnes (whose
brother all men knowe what place he hath w<sup>th</sup> us) many did
suppose that it was not w<sup>th</sup>out our liking; that he undertooke
the transporting of them, untill by our prohibition the
contrary was made manifest. Although these be the excuses,
w<sup>ch</sup> our Councell of Scotland have made to us for this erro<sup>r</sup>,
yet have they not so satisfied us therew<sup>th</sup>, that that wee have
lett them knowe how much wee mislike some dullnes of
theirs, w<sup>ch</sup> they <span class="screenonly">can̅ot</span><span class="handonly">ca{n}ot</span> avoyd; And wee doe assure o<sup>r</sup>self that
hereafter no like thing will happen; and pray the King to
be perswaded; that if any of ours shall soe farre forth forgett
themselves as to serve any Adversarye of his; wee shall
impute it to them for no lesse fault, then if they served an
Enemy of our owne;</p>

<p>As for that point; concerning Andrew Ramsey, wherew<sup>th</sup>
the King doth charge him; that having heretofore (after
service don to the late King of Sweeden) found favo<sup>r</sup> at
the King o<sup>r</sup> brothers hande; and given his faith to him
never to serve the King of Sweeden against him more; wee
are so much displeased w<sup>th</sup> his cariage therein; as we meane
to take a due tryall thereof; and if he doe not give us satisfaccon
although by course of Lawe the fact be of that nature
as hath no punishment p<sup>r</sup>scribed; yet shall o<sup>r</sup> usage towarde
him be such; as all men shall perceive how farre wee mislike

wee take to speedie order to have a tryall made what he
could answere to the fowle fact of breach of his faith to the
Kings Ministers who had him prisoner w<sup>ch</sup> yo<sup>r</sup> lres did charge
him w<sup>th</sup>; for w<sup>ch</sup> purpose, he being called before o<sup>r</sup> Councell
hid himself; and being often <span class="screenonly">sum̅oned</span><span class="handonly">su{m}oned</span> and not appearing, is
for his contempt at the Horn, whereby yo<sup>u</sup> may say unto the
King, he hath now given us a good ground to punishe him
by coorse of lawe; for that before although his fact proving
true; we might have ever thought of him as a naughtie and
unworthie person, yet could wee not have inflicted any
punishement uppon him, for that the declaring of Shelmo is
not in use w<sup>th</sup> us. But now having out of his owne fact
putt himself in the daunger of the lawe wee have ground to
proceed against him; whereby the King and all men shall
see how much we detest such acts.</p>

<p>Wee have also taken a coorse to trye whenne the moneys
came w<sup>ch</sup> wee heard he had distributed to the men he levyed;
And we doe find that the money came not out of Sweeden;

had any kynd off commission or warrant to shew, nather

<p>In the year 1612, on the fifteenth day of the month of
October, in the garden of the Most Serene and Powerful
Prince and Lord, CHRISTIAN the Fourth, King of Denmark,
Norway, etc., and our most gracious Liege, was Alexander
Ramsay brought into the presence of us, Robert
Anstruther, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem</i>. Ambassador of His Most Serene Majesty
of Great Britain, Christian Friis, and Brinde Rantzow, councillors
of the realm of Denmark, and in answer to divers
questions made the statements which do hereinafter follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>That he had been appointed to the post of lieutenant-colonel
by Andrew Ramsay; that the said Andrew had
declared that he had been appointed to the office of colonel
by a letter from Charles, King of Sweden, but he had himself
seen no such letter; that there had been no agreement
concerning pay; that he had been led to hope that he
would receive as much pay as any other lieutenant-colonel
serving in Sweden.</p>

<p>When reproached with having gone beyond the commands
of His Majesty of Great Britain, he set forth in his
defence that he had relied on the word of the aforesaid
Andrew Ramsay; for he had said that those things were
being done with the knowledge and approval of His aforesaid
Sacred Majesty of Great Britain.</p>

<p>That an agreement had been made between three persons,
himself and two others, George Sinclair and George Hay,
each being in command of a hundred infantry.</p>

<p>That he, Alexander, had embarked at Dundee; but the
two aforesaid captains had set sail from Caithness, one of
the islands which are reckoned among the Orkneys (<em>sic</em>), but
distant three German miles from the Orkneys.</p>

<p>That all these things were unknown to the Council of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
kingdom of Scotland, nor had any permission been applied
for; but that relying on the words and promises of the
aforesaid Andrew Ramsay, they had crossed the sea.</p>

<p>That a stopping-place had been fixed upon beforehand off
Shetland, where Mönnichhofen, furnished with a thousand
soldiers and three thousand arms, as also General(?) Hacket
(Halkett) of Scotland, with a thousand infantry, were to meet,
the number increasing to three thousand.</p>

<p>That they had set sail from that place on the second day
of August. That he, Alexander Ramsay, had spent four
hundred pounds sterling upon a hundred soldiers; for that
greater expenses were incurred in enlisting soldiers privily
and secretly than (by enlisting them) publicly.</p>

<p>That James Nisbet of Edinburgh had taken upon himself
the risk which the ship might incur. That the Norwegian
peasants had shown them the way, when they had landed at
Romsdal in Iisfiord.</p>

<p>At this examination were present James Moneypenny and
James Scott.</p>

<p>That more reliance may be placed on this examination and deposition
of the aforesaid Alexander Ramsay, we have wished to
corroborate these statements by the signatures of our own hands.</p>

<p>Done at Copenhagen, the 15th day of the month of
October, in the year, etc., 1612.</p>

Andream Ramsö, qui una cum duobus Locumtenentibus,

et quemlibet separatim examini submitteremus.</p>

<p>1. Ubi locorum familiaritatem primò colere ceperint, quo
hospitio et hospite usi sint.</p>

<p>2. Quomodo commeatum vel abeundi facultatem obtinuerit.</p>

quinam eorum ad conscribendum militem extra regnum,
degant.</p>

<p>4. Quorum conterraneorum, et ad quos literas secum ferant.
Nullum enim dubium, quin tam Stuardus, quàm alii
ad suos amicos, literas dederint.</p>

<p>5. Quidnam Stuardus cum literis salvi conductus, Calmariæ
a Nobis acceptis, egerit.</p>

<p>6. Causam dicat, cur Stuardus ab omnibus Suecis, Regis
magnæ Britanniæ, appelletur legatus.</p>

<p>7. Quasnam conditiones obtulerint Stuardo, ipsius ære se
liberandi.</p>

<p>Vicetenens speciatim interrogandus, quomodo à Capitaneo
suo discesserit, et sub quo summo Duce stipendia fecerit.</p>

<p>Cùm vero meridianâ sit luce clarius, ejusmodi viris, qui
diu in Suecia militarem operam præstiterunt, sine specialioribus
passagii literis, abitum minime concedi, quo pacto inde
solverit.</p>

<p>Hoc clementissimo mandato accepto, statim Ottonis, arcis
præfecti conclave, locum comparendi præfato Ramsö assignavimus,
ibidem eundem separatim examinavimus, et quæ
sequuntur, in medium proferentem audivimus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Ad primum articulum: Locumtenentem, hic sibi comitem
consanguineum suum esse: Eundem Stockholmiæ, in diversorio
Ducis Johannis, cuivis ibi loci noto, quando cum suo
capitaneo Lörmundt, etiam Scoto, ex Livonia, ubi per quinquennium
militasset veniret, casu in se incidisse. Se, Ramsö,
dicto vicetenenti veniam apud Ducem Gustavum impetrasse.</p>

<p>Ad secundum: Nullas sibi, neq<sup>e</sup> Regis, neq<sup>e</sup> Ducum, Gustavi
et Johannis, verùm unas tantum Vicetenentis Stockholmiæ,
in suum ipsius duorum Locum-tenentium totidemq<sup>e</sup>
famulorum usum, salvi conductus literas fuisse, quas
Waxholmi, antequam navim ascendissent, redditas post se
reliquisset.</p>

<p>Ad tertium: Sequentes Duces et præfectos militum, adhuc
in Suecia commorari; Summum Ducem Roderfört, Scotum,
ejusdem Locum-tenentem Lormundt; Horum Legionem vel
regimen constare 8 vel 9 cohortibus; Capitaneum Wachop;
Munichow; Summum Ducem Due; Casparum Matzen;
Græc, Scotum, magistrum machinarum fulminalium. In
obsidione Calmariæ, Sclopetæ globo jamdictu Graec tibiam
alteram ita vulneratam, ut 20 ossicula exempta fuerint,
atq<sup>e</sup> jam num de vita ipsius desperari. An aliqui, ad conscribendum
externum militem emissi sint, se omnino nescium
esse.</p>

<p>Ad quartum: Nullas se habere literas.</p>

<p>Ad quintum: Stuardum literas salvi conductus navarchæ,
à quo Calmariâ Rusbuy vectus erat, tradidisse, ut èo meliùs
ad suos redire posset; vicetenentem etiam Hafniensem affirmasse,
ad suas manus prædictas literas venisse.</p>

<p>Ad sextum: Vulgum de Stuardo tanquam de Legato sentire;
Stuardum verò hoc ægrè ferre. In aula tamen non
idem de ipso judicium fieri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Ad septimum: Solutionis spe in ver proximum, pecunia
vel cupro interfuturo, Stuardum lactari.</p>

<p>Cæterum: prænominatus Ramsö, per discursum et incidenter
retulit, Dominum de la Ville, Gedanum abiisse, 7,000
Joachimicorum, ibidem sibi numerandorum, literis cambii
acceptis: Verùm nihil, nisi fraudem et vana promissa, expertum
esse: In obsidione Calmariæ latus alterum ipsi globo
ictum:</p>

<p>Dixisse etiam, quamvis ab Angelo cœlis delapso, sibi suaderetur,
ut in Suecia pedem sisteret, nequaquam tamen se
facturum.</p>

<p>Omnes præfectos vel officiales regni Sueciæ, in Calmariæ
obsidione, præter Monnichowen, vulneratos esse: Ea ex
causa, quod cæteros prudentia anteiret, et eminus certare
novisset. Hisce peractis, ipsum in hospitium dimisimus, et
Locumtenentem, Robertum Douglis, accersi curavimus,
eodem planè modo, ut supra ad præfatos articulos responsionem
ejus flagitantes.</p>

<p>Respondit: Se et dictum Ramsö, amitinos esse: In Scotia
uxorem et liberos se habere, ibidemq<sup>e</sup> mali quid perpetrasse;
in Livonia, per sexennium militasse; Lubecam navi, cum
qua captus erat, tendisse; Eandem, pro ut navarcha videndi
copiam fecisset, cuprum et ferrum vehere.</p>

<p>Neq<sup>e</sup> abitus neq<sup>e</sup> conductus literas habere; et nisi in hunc
Ramsö forte incidisset, ex Suecia discedendi potestatem sibi
denegatam fuisse; Spatio 4 annorum, tribus mensibus exceptis,
nihil stipendii se accepisse. Capitaneum suum nunc in
Suecia prope Boosund commorari; Se tres septimanas solummodo
in Suecia substitisse; Nicopingi verò Capitaneum suum
liquisse: Et quamvis commeatum petiisset, nihil tamen, nisi,
abeas, abeas, se ab eo oretenus obtinuisse. A Duce Gustavo,
illum petere, minime ausum fuisse: Capitaneum suum, officia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
sua, Suecis ulterius promisisse: sex prætereà Capitaneos,
natione Scotos, ibidem adhuc inservire: Dominum de la
Barre, circa 500 Equites Suecos ducere; limites defendere;
nullum alias peregrinum superesse militem.</p>

<p>Sex cohortes, 600 Equitum numero, ex Livoniâ proximo
vere exspectari. Se audivisse, quòd in Suecia, ne unica quidem
Germani militis cohors, integra sit. De conscribendo
externo milite, nihil sibi constare, nisi de eo postquam comitia
finem habuerint, quidpiam inaudiri possit.</p>

<p>Gustavum specioso illo verbo, accipietis, accipietis, creditores
æra residua exigentes, prensare et pascere.</p>

<p>Nullas se habere literas, præter unas Mercatoris, cujusdam,
et schedulam cambii, 150 Thalerorum, ad civem quendam
Lubecensem, Hermannum Scheflerum; prædictam schedulam
Rostochium mittendam.</p>

<p>De salvi conductus Stuardi literis, nihil sibi constare.
Stuardum verò præter victum nihil accepisse; ibidem hiemem
consumpturum.</p>

<p>Non esse legatum, Stuardum: Rusticos quidem ita eum
nuncupare: primò ibidem à se visum.</p>

<p>Suecos maximâ consternatione percitos; destitui militibus;
post comitia, huc legatos missum iri; Regem Carolum, à
populo devoveri; Naves prope Stockholmiam, non nautis, sed
Rustica plebe, regi; Pane et halece, vulgò Strömling, victitare:
In Muscovia etiam milites fame perire.</p>

<p>Suecum non habiturum peregrinum, siquidem optimus hisce
in oris jam adsit, militem.</p>

<p>Alterum illum Locum-tenentem, qui nunc Hafniæ, præterita
æstate in Suecia, antea verò in Livonia militasse; ab
hisce aliena non relaturum.</p>

<p>Quod hæc omnia, ut supra consignata sunt, ita interrogaverimus,
et responsiones ad interrogata factas, præsentes audiverimus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>

<p>In the year 1611, on the nineteenth day of the month
of December, His Royal Majesty of Denmark, Norway, etc.,
our most gracious Lord, did most graciously enjoin upon us
the undersigned to interrogate upon the following heads, as
set forth by His Royal Majesty's own hand, a certain Scot,
Andrew Ramsay, who, while crossing by sea from Sweden to
Lubeck with two lieutenants and two servants, had been,
together with the vessel, captured on the voyage and brought
into Copenhagen, and had afterwards, accompanied by one
lieutenant, made his way to this place; and, further, to submit
each of them to separate examination:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Where did these two first become intimate? At whose
house and at whose hands did they receive entertainment?</p>

<p>2. How he obtained a letter of safe-conduct or a permission
to leave the country.</p>

<p>3. How many foreign officers are still in Sweden, and who
of them are engaged in raising troops abroad.</p>

<p>4. From whom among their countrymen and to whom they
are conveying letters. For there is no doubt that Stuart as
well as others have given letters to their friends.</p>

<p>5. What Stuart did with the letter of safe-conduct which
he received from us at Calmar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Let him tell the reason why Stuart is called by all the
Swedes ambassador of the King of Great Britain.</p>

<p>7. What conditions they have offered to Stuart with a
view to freeing themselves from their debt to him.</p>

<p>The lieutenant to be asked especially how he came to leave
his captain, and under what commander (general?) he has
served.</p>

<p>And since it is clearer than noonday that men like these,
who have long served in Sweden, would by no means be
allowed to leave the country without a special passport, how
he managed to get away from thence.</p>

<p>Immediately after this most gracious mandate had been
received, we assigned to the said Ramsay the private chamber
of Otto, the governor of the castle, as the place where he
should present himself, and there we examined him separately,
and heard him make openly the following statements:&mdash;</p>

<p>In answer to the first question&mdash;</p>

<p>That the lieutenant, his companion here, was a relative of
his. That he had fallen in with him by chance at Stockholm
in the country-house of Duke John&mdash;a house well
known to every one in that place&mdash;on his return with his
captain, Learmonth, also a Scot, from Livonia, where he had
served for five years. That he, Ramsay, had obtained leave
to go (pardon?) from Duke Gustavus for the said lieutenant.</p>

<p>To the second&mdash;</p>

<p>That he had had no letter of safe-conduct either from the
King or from Dukes Gustavus and John, but only one from
the lieutenant-governor of Stockholm, for the use of himself,
his two lieutenants, and his two servants, which letter he
had given up and left behind him at Waxholm<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> before they
embarked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p>To the third&mdash;</p>

<p>That the following commanders and officers were still left
in Sweden:&mdash;General Rutherford, a Scot, and his lieutenant
Learmonth; that their force or regiment consisted of eight
or nine companies; Captain Wauchope; Mönnichhofen;
General Due; Caspar Matzen; Greig, a Scotchman, commander
of the artillery. That at the siege of Calmar the
aforesaid Greig had been so severely wounded in the shin-bone
by a cannon-ball that twenty pieces of bone were
taken out, and even then they had little hope of his life.
That he does not know at all whether any officers have been
sent to levy soldiers abroad.</p>

<p>To the fourth&mdash;</p>

<p>That he has no letters.</p>

<p>To the fifth&mdash;</p>

<p>That Stuart had given up the letter of safe-conduct to the
captain of the ship, who took him from Calmar to Ryswik(?)<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
to facilitate his return home. Besides, the lieutenant-governor
of Copenhagen had stated that the aforesaid letter had
come into his hands.</p>

<p>To the sixth&mdash;</p>

<p>That the common people looked upon Stuart in the light
of an ambassador, and that this annoyed him greatly; but at
the Court he was not regarded in the same light.</p>

<p>To the seventh&mdash;</p>

<p>That Stuart was being cajoled by the hope of payment in
the following spring, either in money or in copper.</p>

<p>Further: the said Ramsay did state, by the way and incidentally,
that the Sieur de la Ville had gone away to Danzig
on the receipt of a letter of credit to the amount of seven
thousand dollars, payable to him at that place, but that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
had met with nothing but lies and vain promises; that at
the siege of Calmar he (de la Ville?) had been struck in the
side by a ball; and, further, he had said that though an
angel were to come down from heaven to persuade him to
set foot in Sweden, he would certainly refuse to do so.</p>

<p>That all the officers or officials in the employment of the
King of Sweden at the siege of Calmar had been wounded,
except Mönnichhofen; and the reason was that he surpassed
the others in prudence, and knew how to fight from
a distance.</p>

<p>After this had been gone through, we dismissed him to
his lodging, and had the lieutenant, Robert Douglas, called,
and in exactly the same manner as above required him to
answer to the aforesaid questions.</p>

<p>He answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>That he and the said Ramsay were cousins; that he had
a wife and children in Scotland, and had committed some
crime there; that he had served for six years in Livonia;
that he had been on his way to Lubeck in the ship in which
he had been captured; that the same ship was carrying a
cargo of iron and copper, as far as the captain had given
him an opportunity of seeing.</p>

<p>That he had no permission to leave the country, or letter
of safe-conduct; and had he not chanced upon this Ramsay,
leave to depart out of Sweden would have been refused him;
that in the course of four years, with the exception of three
months, he had received no pay; that his captain was now
in Sweden in the neighbourhood of Boosund; that he himself
had only stayed three weeks in Sweden, but had left his
captain at Nyköping; and that although he had asked for a
letter of safe-conduct, he had received nothing in answer to
his entreaties but the words, "Begone, begone with you;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
that he had not dared to ask Duke Gustavus for this letter;
that his captain had promised his further services to the
Swedes; that six captains besides, Scotchmen by birth, were
still in the service of the country; that the Sieur de la Barre
was in command of about five hundred Swedish cavalry;
that they were defending the frontier; that no foreign
soldiers were still left in any other place.</p>

<p>That six troops of cavalry, six hundred in all, were expected
from Livonia next spring; that he had heard it said
that there is not even one company of German soldiers in
Sweden left entire. About the enrolment of soldiers abroad
he knows nothing, though something may possibly be heard
on the subject, after the session of the council is over.</p>

<p>That Gustavus was putting off and nourishing (the hopes
of) his creditors, who were demanding their arrears of payment,
with the specious words, "Be sure you shall be paid,
be sure you shall be paid."</p>

<p>That he had no letter, except one from a merchant, a letter
of credit for one hundred and fifty thalers to a citizen of
Lubeck, named Hermann Schefler; that the said letter was
to be sent to Rostock.</p>

<p>That he knew nothing about Stuart's letter of safe-conduct;
that Stuart had received nothing except his food;
that he was going to spend the winter there; that Stuart
was not an ambassador; that the country people indeed
called him so; that he had seen Stuart for the first time in
Sweden.</p>

<p>That the Swedes were thoroughly panic-stricken; they
were deserted by their soldiers; after the session was over
envoys would be sent here (to treat for peace); that King
Charles was execrated by the people; the ships at Stockholm
were manned with peasants, not sailors; they had to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
on bread and fish-brine, called by the natives "<em>Strömling</em>;"
that in Russia, too, the soldiers were dying by famine.</p>

<p>That the Swedes would not succeed in getting foreign
soldiers, as the best were already engaged in these parts
(Denmark).</p>

<p>That the other lieutenant, who was now at Copenhagen,
had served in Sweden during the past summer, and previously
in Livonia; that the account he would give would not differ
from the present.</p>

<p>That we did put all these questions as set down above,
and that we did hear with our own ears the answers given
to those questions, we bear witness with the signature of our
own hands and seals.</p>

<p>Done at Fredericksborg on the 19th day of December 1611.</p>

* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Now for yo<sup>r</sup>self; we cannot but take it in ill part from yo<sup>u</sup>,
that wee heare so sealdome from yo<sup>u</sup>; and thinck yo<sup>u</sup> are,
instead of an Ambassado<sup>r</sup>, become a Secretary to keepe Councell:
for to the severall dispatches wee have made to yo<sup>u</sup>,

received no aunswere from yo<sup>u</sup>. In all w<sup>ch</sup> we advertised
yo<sup>u</sup> of o<sup>r</sup> proceeding upon the rumo<sup>r</sup> wee heard of the Levyes
in Scotland; and what coorse wee had taken w<sup>th</sup> Andrew
Ramsey; And willed yo<sup>u</sup> to acquaint the king w<sup>th</sup> both.</p>

</p>

<p>Last of all; concerning Andrew Ramsey; as wee have written
before; that if he fell into o<sup>r</sup> handes wee wold so proceed w<sup>th</sup>
him; as shold give the king <span class="screenonly">satisfac̅c̅o̅n̅:</span><span class="handonly">satisfa{ccon}:</span> So may yo<sup>u</sup> lett the
King understand that the said Andrew Ramsey being first
fugitive in Scotland (as wee have before sent yo<sup>u</sup> word) and
secretly comed into England, moved there a quarrell to S<sup>r</sup>
Robert Carre of Ankram, for discovering to us (as he said;
whereby the king may see how his proceeding was w<sup>th</sup>out o<sup>r</sup>
privitie) Andrew Ramseys gathering of men in Scotland;
By occasion of w<sup>ch</sup> Quarrell he came to be apprehended:
whome as soone as wee had, wee caused first to be examined
by some of o<sup>r</sup> councell, as well upon the pointes the king
charged him w<sup>th</sup>, as upon the transgressing of his duty towardes
us; to w<sup>ch</sup> pointes wee have sent yo<sup>u</sup> his aunswere
under his owne hand. And upon this Confession of his, his
fault being of that nature as doth not by any Lawe here or
in Scotland forfaite life or Lymme; and the custome of declaring
Schellum being not w<sup>th</sup> us in use; wee have by oure warrant
under oure hande banished him out of all oure Dominions;
w<sup>ch</sup> next unto death, is the highest punishment wee could
inflict; And for the rest of his company; you may assure the
King wee find them innocent of any fault; and only misled
by his authority; whoe assuring them he had our connivence,
and having a Brother so nere about us, was easily beleeved;
especially using no open proceeding w<sup>th</sup> drumme, but
gathering them w<sup>th</sup> silence and secrecye, it carryed a shew as
though wee had permitted it. But he having therein abused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
us as well as them; hath now receaved the punishment due
to so lewd a part. As for the prisoners sent unto us you may
say, finding them likewise no otherwise in fault then as abused
by Ramsey; Wee have sent them home to their countrye.
And for Bruce; we sawe no cause to punishe him, seeing the
King himself layeth nothing to his Charge; but that he refused
to be a Gaoler to the rest.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_137" id="Footnote_137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_137"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> There appears to be no record in Norwegian history of these piratical
visits. They may possibly have been undertaken with the view of selecting
a place of disembarkation for the Scottish levies. The Earl of Orkney
in question was one of the great feudal lords of Scotland. He committed
"many extravagant excesses of arbitrary authority amongst the wild recesses
of the Orkney and Zetland Islands;" and having at length shown
some token of a wish to assume sovereign power, he was tried and executed
at Edinburgh on the 6th February 1614 ("Tales of a Grandfather"). In
the Swedish State Archives is preserved a letter, dated London, April 4,
1611, from "Robert Stewart" to Steinbock, Swedish ambassador at the
Hague, urging that if money be sent there is a good opportunity of engaging
men, as "thair is sum companeis to be cassered out of holand ... this
nixt mounth." There is also an earlier letter from him to the same
ambassador, dated London, December 10, 1610, recommending the bearer,
Captain Stewart, for employment, and asking, "Hwat seruice your maister
the King of Sueden will employ me with and wpon what condiciounes.
Without mony I noe he can do no seruice to the Kyng your (L) maister."
On the 29th November 1610 the Duke of "Lenox" wrote to Steinbock,
warmly recommending Captain James Stuart, who desired to repair a
second time to Sweden. Another letter from him (likewise in the Swedish
Archives), relating to William Stuart, will be found on <a href="#Page_178">page 178</a>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_139" id="Footnote_139"></a><a href="#FNanchor_139"><span class="label">[139]</span></a> The removal of the royal residence from Edinburgh attracted to England
Scotch courtiers and men of rank who made fortunes by King
James's favour. On the other hand, the sons of the gentry and better
classes, "whose trade had been war and battle," were deprived of employment
by the general peace with England, and the Scottish nation felt at
the same time the distress arising from an excess of population. "To
remedy the last evil," says Sir Walter Scott, "the wars on the Continent
afforded a resource peculiarly fitted to the genius of the Scots, who have
always had a disposition for visiting foreign parts."</p></div>

unto ws, we understood that he haid apprehendit a nomber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>

last point we nather could then nor yett can understand
what it meaneth, for whareas it is said that thair is a
Colonell and certane Capitanes leveying men thair to go to

promeis maid to our deare bruther the King of Denmark:
in respect quhairof we planelie refuisit the King of Swaden
to assist or send ony of oure subjectis to his service and also
recalled Sir James Spens of Wolmerstoun not sufferring him
ather ony longer to serve the said King or to remane in his
dominionis till now that we haif sent him as our ambassadour
It is thairfoir our pleasour that ye certifie us what
that leveying of soldiouris meaneth by what authoritie it is
done and that ye mak stay of all proceiding thairin till
yee sall be adverteist of oure fardir pleasour concerning

<p>Our gracious favour, special benignity and grace, etc.
Illustrious and noble, our truly and dearly beloved Sir James
Spens; we have no doubt that you keep fresh in memory
your sacred and true promise to the most serene and mighty
Prince and Lord, <span class="smcap">Charles</span> the Ninth, King of the Swedes,
the Goths, Vandals, etc., our dearly beloved Lord and Sire,
of highly extolled memory, (as to) what his Royal Majesty
graciously required from you in his letters. Therefore, inasmuch
as the war, unrighteously entered upon by the King
of Denmark against our Sovereign Sire, predeceased in the
odour of sanctity, against ourselves, and against our country,
is continued, and we are in need of foreign soldiers as well
[as native], wherewith to check the attacks of the enemy,&mdash;on
this account we request you with all courtesy to hasten your
return to us with those promised three thousand soldiers of
proved faithfulness and bravery, and, namely, infantry (for
we do not care to have cavalry); and that you will do your
best to be present in Elfsborg Harbour by the first of April<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in this next coming year, with the before-mentioned number
of troops, properly equipped with the needful accoutrements.
Now, that you may be in a condition to do this the more
successfully and easily, and that we, without delay and interruption,
may be able to avail ourselves of your services
and those of your soldiers against our enemies, we shall
graciously order twenty thousand imperials, to be paid in the
city of Hamburg, to you or to those fully authorized by you,
through the agents of the Most Serene Queen, our dearly
beloved Mother, and our own, urgently entreating you not to
hesitate to observe the same loyalty by which you were held
bound to our Most Serene Father of very glorious memory, to
our Most Serene Mother also, to ourselves and our realms.
Moreover, while we are surely persuaded that all these
things, and others that concern our safety and the aggrandizement
of our kingdom (which things we leave to your
judgment and discretion), will be attended to by you with
the utmost care, you will rest assured that the aforesaid
sum, as also whatever you shall disburse in our name upon
the above-mentioned soldiers over and above the twenty
thousand imperials, shall be most graciously repaid by us at
the proper time. Furthermore, we have thought right
that it should be notified to you that we have arranged with
our general, our truly beloved Johannes Mœnichovius, that
he is to transport his thousand infantry, fully furnished
with necessary arms, from Holland to Elfsborg in the beginning
of the spring. If, therefore, you combine your fleet
and army with the ships of the aforesaid Mœnichovius, we
shall be extremely glad. For thus the combined fleet would
be not merely equal to the enemy's fleet, if it should chance
to come in contact with you, but, as we are justified in
hoping, far superior. And we have considered that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
should not be concealed from you. Herewith we graciously
commend you to the protection of the divine Deity (Power).

<p class="noindent fs90">(<em>Address.</em>)</p>

<p>Our most friendly greeting now and ever in the Lord!
Dear Lord Chancellor, particularly good friend, we thank
the Chancellor kindly for favours evinced, which we would
at all times desire to repay in whatever manner might be to
the honour or benefit of the Chancellor.</p>

<p>In the next place, we cannot omit to communicate to the
Chancellor somewhat at length, on account of the nature of
the matter, how on or about the 19th or 20th of August
last two Scottish ships arrived off Romsdalen, in the province
of Bergenhuus, with a number of soldiers, and landed them
there. What ports those ships hailed from, and by whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>they were fitted out, as also who it was that procured them,
is to be ascertained from their own report and deposition
hereunto annexed.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>And straightway the next day after their arrival they
betook themselves inland, and proceeded along the country
road over a fjeld called Mæratoppene, whereupon they
entered the valley of Gudbrandsdal, which is to the southward
of the mountain range, and in this province of
Aggershuus; and they had taken with them two Bönder
of Romsdalen as guides. But when one of his Royal
Majesty's lensmen in the parish of Vaage, which is situated
in the above-mentioned bailiwick of Gudbrandsdal, by
name Lauritz Hage, perceived this, he at once roused
the Bönder and peasantry in the two parishes of Læssöe
and Vaage, and went forth against the said Scots and
foreign troops. And when he perceived they were too
strong for him, he advanced for two or three days and kept
before them along the road, without, however, engaging in
any skirmish or fight. Meanwhile, he sent messengers to
the peasantry in the two adjoining parishes, called Froen
and Ringeböe, who quickly came to his assistance; and
when they were in this manner gathered they were four
hundred and five men strong. Thus he advanced in front
of them along the road until he saw his advantage at a
fjeld called Kringelen, situated in Vaage parish, which they
were obliged to pass. Thus he hemmed them in between
the rock on one side and a large river close by on the other
side, in which advantageous position he quietly encamped
in the woods, and there lay with his men until the foreign
soldiers arrived there, without, however, supposing or knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
aught but that the Norwegian troops were still withdrawing
along the road before them.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned Lauritz Hage, having made his arrangements
and perceived his advantage, attacked, together
with another lensmand, Peder Rankleff of Ringeböe, and
with all their men together they fired upon the foreign
troops and shot them to death during an hour and a half.
Those who were not shot jumped into the river to save
themselves, but were there drowned; and those of them who
got alive over the river were quickly killed by the Bönder
on that side,&mdash;all of which happened and occurred on the
26th of August last.</p>

<p>From the Bönder who were themselves present at the
battle, and who buried and counted the dead and the defeated,
we learn that the foreign soldiers must no doubt have
numbered at the least five hundred and fifty men, although
the Scots who remained alive, and of whom there are altogether
eighteen, will not admit that they were more than
three hundred and fifty men strong at the utmost.</p>

<p>On the day the battle took place one hundred and thirty-four
Scots were taken prisoners, who were straightway the next
day killed and shot by the Bönder, with the exception of the
above-mentioned eighteen, the Bönder saying to each other
that his Royal Majesty had enough to feed in those same
eighteen. Some of these were, however, wounded, and some
had bullets in their bodies when they arrived here. Of the
above-mentioned eighteen soldiers we now send to you the three
principal ones, who are a captain of the name of Alexander
Ramsay, and his lieutenant of the name of Jacob Mannepenge
(James Moneypenny), who has previously been both
in Denmark and Sweden, and who on this their expedition
served as an interpreter. The third is called Herrich Bryssz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
(Henry or Harry Bruce), who, according to his own statement,
has served as a soldier in Holland, Spain, and Hungary.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>As regards the remaining fifteen persons, some of them
have straightway taken service among good folk here in the
country; some of them who will willingly serve your Royal
Majesty in Jörgen Lunge's regiment I sent at once to Elfsborg.
What has further occurred in this matter is, as already
stated, all to be ascertained from their own statements, which
are written down. As to what knowledge can be obtained
from the letters that were found on them we can say
nothing this time, for when they (the Scots) were taken
prisoners the Bönder took all those letters to themselves,
from which we now have our certain knowledge, (and) what
can be ascertained from them, so soon as we receive them,
shall be straightway sent to the Chancellor; and if we on
our part can serve the Chancellor to his honour, advantage,
and command, he shall always find us willing. The Chancellor
is hereby commended to God Almighty. Done at
Aggershuus the 17th of September 1612.</p>

<p class="noindent fs90">(<em>Address.</em>)</p>

<p>To the honourable and well-born men, Christian Friis of
Borreby, His Royal Majesty's Chancellor, and Breide Ranndtzow
of Ranndtzshollen, His Majesty's Stadtholder, our particularly
good friends, addressed in perfect friendliness.</p>

<p>Our most friendly greeting now and ever in the Lord.
Dear friends, we thank you kindly for favours evinced,
which we would at all times desire to repay, in whatever
manner might be to your honour or benefit.</p>

<p>Dear friends, our last letter to you announced that, so soon
as we received information from the bailie in Gudbrandsdal
of certain letters found on the Scots who were defeated and
taken prisoners at that place, we would forward it to you as
soon as we received the letters, in case that any reliable
information should be found in them respecting their plans
and armament. And we do not believe that there is anything
in them from which any information on those points
can be obtained, so far as the said letters can be correctly
read or construed.</p>

<p>We have now recently been written to and informed that
their real colonel<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and captain, the person mentioned by the
Scots themselves in the Scottish Relation (which we sent you
last), is now at sea with four ships filled with soldiers, with
the same intention as the others of landing the troops somewhere
in this country, and afterwards proceeding with them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>into Sweden. This the bailie at Sondmöer has written to
Lauritz Gram, who is bailie in Gudbrandsdalen. This appears,
however, not to be true, seeing that His Royal
Majesty of England has forbidden them to do this, as is to
be further seen by the before-mentioned Relation which was
forwarded to you.</p>

<p>We have also since ascertained that those Scots who were
defeated and captured on their march through this country
have absolutely neither burned, murdered, nor destroyed
anything on their march through this country, either in
Romsdalen, or in Gudbrandsdalen, excepting alone one Danish
man, who lives in the Romsdal, Söffrenn Settnes; from him
they have taken a box filled with various kinds of silver,
both tankards, belts, "stabbe," and other such wrought silver,
which man has now recently been in Gudbrandsdalen, to the
bailie there, and wanted to get back his silver, if any of it
had been found on the defeated Scots; but the Bönder of
Gudbrandsdalen will not hitherto acknowledge having got
any. If otherwise is subsequently found to be the case, it
shall all be returned to him. And it was the plan of the
before-mentioned Scots to have made their way into Sweden
through Gudbrandsdalen, over a mountain called Österdalsfjeld,
in the parish of Tönset, which they all could have done
easily in five days' time at the utmost, had not God the
most Almighty by this defeat ... them.</p>

<p>Of the Norwegian people were only shot ... six men
and ten or twelve somewhat "saa" ... (? saarede = wounded)
... remain alive. This ... "ligen"(?) will let you
know.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> And we will personally do whatever may be to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
service or pleasure. Commending you hereby to God the
most Almighty. Done at Aggershuus the third of October
in the year 1612.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
